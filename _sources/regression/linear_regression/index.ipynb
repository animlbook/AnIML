Instead of trying to write out a program to determine the price by hand, we will give historical data to the computer and let it learn the pattern.\n",

In our context of housing prices, there is one data input for each house (the square footage), but in other contexts, we will see that we are allowed to have multiple data inputs. The outcome for the house is its sale price, and we use the variable $y$ to represent that. Do note that this $y$ variable generally goes by many names such as **outcome/response/target/label/dependent variable**.\n",

There are probably more factors outside the square footage that affect a house's price, so we are never hoping to find an exact relationship between this input and our output; just one that is \"good enough\".

This is a popular starting point because it is simpler than many other types of models (e.g., that \"deep learning\" thing you might have heard of in the news). In fact, its simplicity is generally one of its biggest strengths! Linear regression is commonly used as a good place to start on a new project since it can form a good baseline.\n",

    "$$y_i = w_0 + w_1x_1 + \\epsilon_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a more specific case of the general model we were discussing earlier. We are assuming a linear structure between the input and target, and allowing for some fluctuation ($\\varepsilon_i$) since we don't expect our model to be perfect. In other words, we are stating that our unknown true function $f(x)$ is of the form $w_0 + w_1 x$ where $w_0$ and $w_1$ are unknown to us.\n",
    "\n",

Our journey started with a very broad task of relating input and output variables, where there are an infinite number of possibilities for plausible relationships. We reduce the possibilities here by *making the assumption*<sup>5</sup> that there is a linear relationship between input and output.\n",
    "\n",
    "These (unknown) constants $w_0$ and $w_1$ are known as the **parameters** of the model. These parameters are values that need to be learned by our ML system. While we are making the assumption the function is linear, we need to learn exactly which values dictate this $w_0$ and $w_1$.\n",

Under our model that includes this uncertainty, the formula above defines the most likely outcome given the dataset we were given to train on. This comes from the fact that the noise of the model is equally likely to be positive/negative. In other words, there is no benefit predicting something above/below this most likely value. The technical name for this procedure is *maximum likelihood estimation*.\n",

    "\n",
    "In a few sections, we will define the specifics of how we estimate these unknown parameters using some ML algorithm. As a brief preview, many ML algorithms for linear regression essentially boil down to trying many possible lines and identify which one is \"best\" from that set.

Mean Absolute Error (MAE) is the sum of the errors but using the absolute value instead of squaring $MAE(w_0, w_1) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left| \\hat{y}_i - y_i \\right|$.

It's not the case that we can try every possible $w_0, w_1$‚Äã since they can be real numbers (e.g., 14.3 or -7.4568).

It turns out with a little ML theory, we can prove that this function will be \"bowl-like\" as it is shown in the image above. Proving this is a bit more complex than we care to handle, but the intuition comes from the fact hat MSE is the sum of a bunch of squared functions, and since squared functions look \"bowl-like\" their sum will also look \"bowl-like\". Now what we care to know is that if we know that our function is shaped like a bowl, there is a clever algorithm called **gradient descent** that helps us minimize the function without trying *every possible input*.\n",

One of the very powerful things about gradient descent is it actually works really well for learning many different types of models!

Note that the equation above for general regression is still a linear function ($ax + by + ...$) in the space of considering each feature its own value. In reality, it's possible and common for each feature to be related to our input $x$. The learned function doesn't look linear in the *input space* ($x$) but is linear in the *feature space* ($h(x)$). The reasoning for this point is not particularly important, but it is useful to know that all of these regression models we have discussed really do boil-down to linear regression with more/less complicated *features*.\n",

    "You have the freedom to choose which data inputs you select to use as features and how you transform them. Conventionally, you use $h_0(x) = 1$ so that $w_0$ is the intercept. But then for example, you could make $h_1(x) = x[1]$ (the sq. ft.) and make $h_{12}(x) = \\log(x[7]) * x[2]$. Generally adding more features means your model will be more complex which is not necessarily a good thing<sup>12</sup>. Choosing how many features and what (if any) transformations to use a bit of an art and a science, so understanding in the next chapter how we evaluate our model is extremely important.\n",
    "\n",
    "üìù As a notational remark, we should highlight that it's very common for people to assume that the data table you are working with has already been preprocessed to contain the features you want. They do this to avoid having to write $h_0(x) = 1$, $h_1(x) = ...$, everywhere in their work. It's important to remember that there is an explicit modeling step of transforming raw data to features (even if its implicit and not shown in the notation) and should double check what type of data you are working with.\n",

    "It can't be overstated the importance of how deciding which data you use and which features you derive from it have on your resulting model. Not even the fanciest machine learning algorithms can save you from disaster if you, as the modeller, choose features that have no relation, or worse, trick you into thinking there is a relation there when there is not. Most machine learning techniques rely on finding **correlations**  between the input/output. As you have hopefully heard **correlation is not causation**. Just because your model can find a relationship between the features you choose and your output doesn't actually mean such a relationship exists. A common example is that you can find a good linear relationship with the number of ice cream cones sold in a month (input) and the number of shark attacks (output), although most people don't think ice cream causes shark attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is incredibly important that you think carefully about what data you are including as it can effect the real-world decisions your model might make. In the data table above, we listed \"owner's age\" as a data input. Is that something that is appropriate to use a feature for our model? Why does that seem less appropriate to include than something like square footage? And these choices have real consequences. For example, [some companies problematically underestimate a house's value by a wide margin when they assume the house is owned by a Black family](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/18/realestate/housing-discrimination-maryland.html). This happens because they (intentionally or, more likely, unintentionally) use the owner's race as part of their modeling process.\n",

    "Remember that which data you include is *the first and most important* modelling step, even if most machine learning practitioners rush past that part and focus more on the fanciest machine learning method the can apply.\n",

    "## Recap / Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we introduced the machine learning pipeline as it is applied to regression models, namely linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "We introduced some terminology that we will use throughout the book like the difference between a model and a predictor, the format of the data we learn from, how we can determine features of the model, and how to learn and assess a predictor. We will see these general ideas in the ML pipeline surface frequently in this book. It is always good to start using that as a reference point for the new concepts you are learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "We specifically discussed the context of regression and linear regression. Understanding how to formulate a problem as a regression problem and use linear regression to help you learn a predictor is a very important skill as part of your journey to mastering machine learning! Additionally, understanding how linear regression and polynomial regression are really the same model with different sets of features is a very powerful building-block on that journey.\n",
