-1,I should have stayed with Idahoan brand Poor Betty is on her last legs rolling downhill into oblivionIve used several brands of potato flakes and found them very good But not Bettys brand The finished product tastes stale Bland unpleasant not worth continuing eatingbut the worst part is STALE  I am totally ashamed of Amazon for offrering these packets My advice to any customer looking for good mashed potato flakes Move on to Idahoan or another brand and leave poor Betty by the waysideWhere these packets should have been left Alone Ignored Skipped over By the way I didnt like them
1,As the pasta cooked I read the box to see what makes this smmmile itsveggie pasta  cheese  Cauliflower pasta Id never heard of such a thing What a good idea  The dinner on the whole has two grams fewer of carbohydrates at 47g carbohydrate 7g sugar I was hoping that this would be a good alternative for a diabetic friend but it wont beMy only deviation from the recipe on the box was using 1 milk  I didnt doctor it with extra ingredients or by adding vegetables because I wanted to taste what it tasted like on its ownIt tasted like Kraft Macaroni and Cheese the stuff that my mom occasionally fed us when we were kids  The pasta was soft but not mushy The cheese concoction tastes the same as the standardNot as good as my friend Meems homemade  its not even the same category  but DEFINITELY better than adequate as a comfort food from ones childhoodThe other member of my household agreed on all points including since sneaking vegetables in our household was never an issue that this would taste even yummier with fresh broccoli or cauliflower in itMore Kraft Macaroni and Cheese please
1,I really like this cereal The flavor is slightly nutty and it doesnt get soggy quickly in almond milk It reminds me of Honey Smacks without any sugar My favorite way to eat it is with some chopped raw almonds flax seeds and a touch of agave nectar
-1,The label on the bowl says 35 grams is in the bowl and that it is 110 calories but when I weighed it myself on my food scale it weighed almost twice that Im confused does the whole bowl really contain 110 calories I really want to know can someone help
-1,Doesnt taste like ginger  Thought it would save me having to grate ginger  but is disappointingly flat in flavor  In fact it has a kind off flavor  Wouldnt buy it again
-1,This is the polar opposite of Sleepytime tea I had one cup last night and I laid in bed and didnt fall asleep till well after midnight and then kept waking up every few minutes after that Worst sleep I have gotten in my entire life Im going back to Sleepytime tea At least that stuff works
-1,I tried these with my JVMelita Pod unit and they produced bland unexceptional coffee  Considering they cost the equivalent of about 20 a pound you might expect more but it is just ordinary java
-1,Looking at the ingredients this has zero pumpkin in it That is why its called pumpkin style Its basically just sugar and preservatives Addendum  Its now 2008 and I noticed that the ingredient list that used to be available is no longer availablehmmhiding something
-1,UPDATE INFO AS OF 1292014List Price 2094Price 491 002  ozYou Save 1603 77002 an oz for 16oz in a pound will be only 032 a bag not 491 as claimed by the seller Flax seeds sells never sells for 2094 a bag as claimed by the seller It seems that the seller keeps changing the sale numbers in order to sell a product Arrowhead is an excellent brand with many great organic products where others fail to produce in organic form but this approach is just misleading and not necessary at allORIGINAL REVIEW 10112013Seller claimsList Price 4061Price 824 004oz  FREE Shipping on orders over 25You Save 3237 80That is misleading No flax sells for 40 a pound At 824 a pound it is 82416515 infact something like more than 051 cents an oz not 004 an oz Arrowhead is a good brand but the seller is misrepresenting the factsMISLEADING LABELING sprinkle a tablespoon of ground seeds 14oz not 16 oz since it is golden not brownIt is shame that Arrowhead with so many fine organic products will misguide consumers just to sell a product In the beginning there was only one color flax which was brown but now there is golden as well Usually in organic form except in supplement form the farmer coup flax or any type of seeds are always more expensive due to their practices which is not sold on Amazon at all Brown and golden have the same nutritional value so I never consume one I mix brown and golden regardless In some cases Golden is more expensive than brown If not specified on the labeling the type of flax then it means brown flax not golden flaxOILS I started consuming flax oil years ago per my physicians advise not knowing that majority forms of flaxseeds are rancid and absolutely worthless due to oil in seeds As whole human body cannot digest any seed that size with that consistency regardless if it is flax sesame amaranth chia millet etc unless cooked or in ground form since human body cannot digest in its natural form As SUPPLEMENT TABLET FORM OIL POWDER GROUND IN BAGS are all worthless and hardly offer any nutrients unless seeds are fresh not old which means rancid not in oil form not in supplement form not hulled ground and consumed within few days kept in dark cold temperatures away from lightsunmoisture since the oil in seeds and nuts go rancid regardless Rancid is a process of Mother Nature and has nothing to do with organic conventional GMO or the type of seed Advising consumers to purchase different brands of flax in oil form or powder or tablet form are all marketing tools as well It is not important even if the oil or the tablet or the powder in bags are even frozen at the time of production till you consume since any seed and I mean any type of seed regardless of the type or brand will go rancid once ground and cracked open since the shell the protection is removed and air will get to the oil of the seed much quicker than when the seed is in a complete unhulled form The best example of rancidity is brown rice Place some in freezer and you will notice in few months it will not even cook since the oils have gone rancid even if you keep the rice in a sealed container wrapped in the most elaborate sealing containers in the world regardless Chia is the only seed that claims it does not need to be ground but that is a marketing tool just like the price of chia is since it comes from outside US and individuals without any knowledge about nutrition always associate those as superior for exotic reasons and pay a hefty price for a food item with less nutrients I ground in my coffee grinder sesame flax chia amaranth hemp then add cocoa isolate protein soy milk and consume it before my workouts on daily basis for its vitamins minerals protein and many nutrients without much spike in my glucose Unhulled seeds are full of nutrients I never consume hulled seeds which are empty calories absolutely worthless since the nutrients have been removed After many years of consuming seeds I chose to ground all seeds myself and seal immediately kept in freezer and consumed within few days which I am very happy with the results since after all looking fit and well is just result of training hard and living a healthy lifestyle which surrounds any professional athlete or a happy individual involved in many sport activities regardlessOMEGA 3 You will never see ALA on any fish you purchase Infact you will never see ALA on any fish oil supplement either you will only see EPA and DHA ALA is not the same as EPA or DHA and it is the same for any brand of flax seed regardless if such flax seed oil is in solid oil form in a bottle or a capsule form Greens nuts seeds fruits and vegetables do not offer any omega3 since omega3 EPADHA is an animal source Flaxseeds offer more ALA than chia 228gr vs 178gr There are two major types of omega3 fatty acids in our diets One type is alphalinolenic acid ALA which is found in plants the other type eicosapentaenoic acid EPA and docosahexaenoic acid DHA is found in fatty fish The body partially converts ALA to EPA and DHA There is no proof what percent of ALA gets converted by human body to EPA or DHA You can consume all ALAs that you want and depending to your genes it may never turn any into omega3 Blood test is the only way to see the affects I get omega 3 from sardines although flaxseeds are important part of my diet since flax offers so many different nutrientsFIBER Fiber is essential for body since fiber absorbs the unwanted liquid in the gut and body has to defecate that blown up fiber which in return lowers cholesterol blood pressure etc and brings comfort and efficiency to human body unlike fat which stays in human body unless needed for energy Flax is high in fiberMINERALS Flax is the king of nutrients when it comes to minerals so important to me as a

1,This cereal taste is good has all the rightingredients can be a snackThey finally have a winner for morninggood job
-1,I am a big fan of Knorr broth and sauce mixes and use them frequently not only because of their great flavors but also their lower sodium content  So I decided to give the Mushroom Rice Sides and the Asian Chicken Fried Rice Sides a try  What a huge disappointment  Not only are they sticky and gummy texturewise they are virtually tasteless  Could not detect any mushroom flavor at all  Tried both the stove top and microwave directions and got the same poor results  Then tried adding broth mix various herbs onions etc all to no avail  The remaining nine packages of each of these are packed up for delivery to the local Food Bank
1,I bought this soup for my roommate because she is addicted to spicy foods  She loves it  I tried it and although the flavor was terrific it was just too spicy for me
1,I liked these  They are different but I cant say bad  We have had wheat and regular  I was fine with them
-1,This is by far the worst tasting canned drink energy or just regular soft drink of any sort that I have ever had The taste can only be described as like cherry cough medicine with all of the medicinal taste pushed to the front I took a big swig to start with and was shocked at how bad it was I followed up with another tentative taste to confirm it really was so horrible and then I asked my wife to try it and see what the flavor was She took a small taste grimaced and said 34Robitussin34On the positive side I drank it on Easter morning so I would stay awake during the sunrise service and then drive for an hour to go to a family gettogether and it did keep me awake
-1,I am a long time lover of Kraft Macaroni and Cheese the blue box please I have tried many different brands of microwavable macaroni and cheese and most are barely edible The Kraft Easy Mac falls into the barely edible category just barelyYou receive 18 pouches with this product THESE ARE NOT the Easy Mac bowls like you see in the stores These are packets that you have to open pour into a bowl and measure and add your own liquid to Like all Kraft Easy Mac the best thing about this product is that its quick and easy to prepare in fact thats the only thing I like about this productThe taste is NOTHING like Kraft Macaroni and Cheese in the blue box This has a powdery blah taste to it The cheese is not strong enough to taste cheesy but too strong to taste plain so it has sort of a milk that thickened consistency and taste and is just disgusting The noodles have that slimy clumpy appearance that many microwavable noodle products suffer from Its not the worst microwavable macaroni and cheese Ive ever eaten but its certainly not something I will buy again in the future
1,i was a bit skeptical at first but its a wonderful addition to eggs chowders anyplace you want a cheesy flavor that tastes like cheese and not a chemical plus it is not salty its a true cheese flavor this is a must have in my kitchen just adding this you can mix it with a buttery spread for a new twist on garlic bread bake it in the oven for a few minutes bread wrapped in foil at 350 my company could not get enough im sure ill come up with more uses stay tuned
1,I havent eaten a pice of bread in so long I dream about it This is pretty good bread very good texture moist and as I eat each slice I think about ways I could change the bread with cinnamon and raisins for breakfast and so on  Very Good
1,I never knew they could dehydrate sour cream before  I cant wait to get started making my own recipes with this product
-1,Compared to Natural Valley protein bars Peanut Almond Dark Chocolate specifically the texture is much less nutty and more like bark Too little chocolate flavor
-1,If you think your going to get that awesome full flavor and aroma you bought in a coffee shop in Kona forget it If you add the cost of this stuffHawaii Rosters you can do better  Its just OK and is not worth the price IMO
-1,I remembered liking this soup and ordered a case  I dont know if they changed the recipe or if there was a problem with the order but this isbleechgummybland  Fortunately the dog will eat it mixed with her dry food so not a total waste
1,if its primarily made from lobster what else is in there I wonder PrimarilyWho uses a word like that on a food label Its primarily delicious among other things things we usually have no energy to talk about after eating a fine meal Im so full of primarily lobster bisque that Ive been making and have come to be addicted to NO I will not share the recipe because I am too full and dont feel like it Primarily
1,This bouillon works wonders in navy beans I put 2 tsp in one pot and Celtic sea salt and thats it It comes out very good and tastes delicious Will purchase again
-1,I was under the impression I was getting a box of 15 bars at least there was nothing otherwise that would indicate something less I received one bar on a hot Saturday afternoon delivered by the Post office The bar was soft and we had to refrigerate it for several minutes before we could taste it The first taste was enough to appreciate the fact we only received one bar of the Think This Chocolate Fudge Bar There is a slightly bitter taste plus there is a lingering dryness that will take a while to disappear While the bar touts only 20g of protein and zero sugar I think we will opt for a High Protein Bar that has more flavor and less of the after lingering effects I just ate a Hershey bar and now the original taste is gone By doing so I messed up terribly the sugar and protein count for todayThe bar states that the mission of thinkThin is to positivity impact the lives and wellness of others and to lead in changing the endemic destruction of weight and poor nutrition related diseases in our country I am afraid the maker has gotten somewhat carried away in hisher ambitious mission statement I may never buy a protein bar again Sorry I do agree that you would probably lose weight since after the first bite I wanted nothing else to eatBy the way the bar does not hold up to the very hot heat outside here in Texas however In have to fault the Post office for part of this since the delivery was made in the late afternoon thus that little bar has been on that truck all day
1,money wise in any case Theyre much cheaper than in any stores in our area The only drawback is cleaning them off and breaking off the stems It might take a while Otherwise no complaints Theyre delicious after soaking them for about 20 minutes in cold water I love them in gravies and over potatoes and pasta
1,Bought for our daughter who just gave birthThis tea is suppose to increase mothers milk for breast feedingOur daughter really didnt have any issues producing milkwe thought it could not hurtWell she loves the taste of the tea and if produces more milkthen she have no problem going back to work filling those containers for our grandson
1,This is one of my favorite lunch staples and something that I try to keep stocked in my food pantry at all times I also love the steak and noodles variety Its much much better than the original version of Cambells chicken noodle soup  and and for the price makes for a tasty lowcal and filling lunch or even dinner Ill doctor it up sometime by adding a little lemon juice fatfree sour cream or mozzarella or parmesan cheese Add a few crackers and its a substantial meal I am particularly happy that this is available through Amazon Prime since I live on a bridgeless island and have to haul my groceries over on a ferry Now periodically a box of this soup is delivered to my cottage porch by the island UPS ladyand with no shipping feegiving me a constant supply on hand
-1,One of my dogs certainly like this little tab  It has not however solve our flea problemsI have two terriers  One which has skin problems and I had hoped Brewers Yeast would help him out  Oddly his tablet has to be mixed into his wet foodFlea control still has to be used  The bottle is still almost full  So I will continue to use it for their coats  But I would not recommend as flea control
1,We make a big pot of this refreshing and gently invigorating green tea every morning Its delicious a blend of white  green tea leaves that brings out the best in each Ive imbibed a great deal of tea from various parts of the world and this is an excellent richly flavorful tea For fun we often add a couple of bags ofCelestial Seasonings Herb Tea Peppermintto the pot its a riff on a Moroccan tradition that mixes mint leaves with tea Enjoy
1,I have to admit I was nervous to try a canned product but I was very pleased The appearance is not great coming out of the can but when you mold it or mix it in with other foods its just like ground beef The taste is very subtle almost nothing which I think is a great benefit because it will absorb the flavor of whatever you cook with it In general Im very happy with this product and Im glad to have found it on Amazon because I have never seen it in a store
1,I enjoyed this  Because I liked it on July 11 I subscribed to get it every two months  I am an Amazon prime customer and expected it would promptly arrive in two days  It is July 15 and it is still not here  Noticed why if you subscribe the arrival date becomes weird and distorted from what is promised to Amazon Prime customers  It is said this is due to a subscribed item being shipped free OMG Rip off Not to get my coffee until July 22  Coffee lover boiling  You need to read Amazon print out details Yessiree  Perhaps a pop up attorney who says whoa cowboy Have a cup of joe and let sit down and talk awhile about what you will be getting when you hiy the buy key  You know not all gold is real gold some is iron pirates Now here when you order there may could be a bit of a wait as it will be put on the slow boat via China because it gets shipped for free  Say that again You shipped what free  Yes sir shipping delay is free with your coffee
-1,You look at the box and you think  a way to sneak in more veggies that no one will notice As good as that might sound you have to look deeper at this box and the product insideI prepared this for my family and I was immediately confused by the nutritional list on the box  Now a nonveggie pasta from Kraft Mac  Cheese has three servings this listed only two but to be blunt it easily fed three people  It also listed only one half serving of vegetables per serving in the box so frankly with one box feeding three of us it was basically adding no vegetable value at allThe taste was basically tasteless We expect a certain cheesiness from Kraft and this just failed utterly  It was salty but not cheesy  The only creaminess was from the milk and butter I added along with some spice when it proved so blandI could take a nice tomato andor spinach pasta and add my own cheese mix to get a product that was tastier and healthier  My family would eat it and be better pleased as well  No one liked it in my household
-1,I am a chocolate fanatic and pairing chocolate with tea only seems natural to me  Ive sampled several chocolate flavors and this Stash tea when compared to the others is nothing spectacular  When unbrewed the Stash tea bag smells like chocolate but that scent does not translate to much of a chocolate flavor once the tea is brewed  I could taste quite a bit of vanilla and some nut but the chocolate was just negligible Additionally there was a strange aftertaste with this tea  It just wasnt pleasantIf you are committed to a chocolate decaffeinated beverage your choices will be limited I have sampled quite a few chocolate teas and many use a black tea base  However if interested in a caffeine free tee that has a good body I would recommendChocolate Chai Tea by Zhenas Gypsy Tea which is a naturally caffeine free tea  Zhenas chocolate chai is supposed to taste like chocolate but it has a lot of spices  StillChocolate Chai Tea by Zhenas Gypsy Teahas a much richer overall flavor than the Stash Premium Chocolate Hazelnut teaIf you dont care about caffeine and are just looking for a chocolate tea there are several others that I would recommend before this one  They includeTisano Organic Chocolate TeaSerendipiTea ChocolaTea Chocolate Vanilla Rooibos  Black Tea 4Ounce Boxes Pack of 2 andBigelow White Chocolate ObsessionTea 16Ounce Boxes Pack of 6  The first two are loose teas and the last is a bagged teaAt the end of the day I dont think I would recommend this Stash tea to any chocolate lover  It doesnt taste like chocolate and the overall flavor is poor
1,Ive been buying these carob chips for years No other chips compare These are just the right amount of sweetness  mimic chocolate Theyre great for baking in place of choc chips but also good to at by themselves out of the bag Also the customer service is great the folks at Barry Farms are awesome
1,Never been a lover of herbal teas but middle age has brought on bouts of insomnia  very sad  anyway  I finally figured out that my great love of tea has been keeping me awake at night and have actually been craving herbal teas  I tried and disliked them intensely when they were popular in the 90s but took another try at it again a few days agoMy biggest problem with them was how any fruit tea tasted so herby to me  But not anymore  These teas and Ive tried them but the peach taste like real fruit  There is an herbal taste but its mellowed rounded and in the background  I actually like them a lot  I am sitting here with the black cherry steaming in a cup and again save the slightest herbal taste it reminds me a life saver cherry candy  I actually taste a definite tartness in the after taste which I loveSo Im sold  The blueberry and raspberry were outstanding and very true to their namesake  and they smell good  Tried both last night and realized that my kitchen smelled like fruit juice when I woke up this morning  I was delighted by that
-1,These noodles were very good but my boxes had bugs in them  small black about half a size of a small ant  Packaging is bad  noodles are not sealed theyre just plain in the box coated in seasoning and all  Any bug can get into this box and feast on tasty noodles  I cant imagine why they made the choice not to put them at least in a sealed plastic bag inside the package Plain noodles are ok theyre completely dry but this product was seasoned  For this reason Id never buy them again  Bugs took good 2 months to get rid of extremely annoying in a completely bugfree home  Now I understand why all seasoned noodles come in plastic packaging  I had to throw out all remaining noodles
1,Okay so I am new to Senseo and ALL of its varieties of coffees The machine came with a sample of Dark Roast Its not that the roast itself was bad it just tasted flat  none of the overtones of the nectar of the gods  and I was sorely disappointed However I was on a mission to make 1 cup at a time having reviewed all the other 1 cup machines out there I was sure that Senseo was not just the best deal but the best machine  and then when all hope seemed lost a light at the end of the tunnel was seen and at its core was Medium Roast This stuff is good coffee people You can taste the nuances and hints of floral chocolately nutty and all those other words that go with describing good coffee so I highly recommend these pods They taste wonderful and will have you returning to the Senseo for another cup before work begins FIVE STARS
-1,We have tried everything to get even one bag to come out correctly  Either it leaves LOTS of kernels in the bag and very little popcorn to eat OR it burns in big globs and at least 14 is burned  We give up  Our microwave is 1200 watts and we have tried the popcorn button AND numerous times tried other times AND we stand there and listen to it  The kernels are still popping vigorously but it is burning inside  Enough is enough  What a shame because it is good tasting what little we get from one  bag but too frustrating

-1,As someone who has been a fan of Ostrim products for the past five years I have probably eaten 300400 of these high protein snacks without incident  Unfortunately this was not the case with my purchase in February of 2011 In an attempt to shave costs off of my high protein diet that can over 1000 dollars per month for one person I decided to purchase 60 Ostrim sticks 3 x 20 in regular barbecue and teriyaki flavors Since the expiration dates of these are generally a year into the future I assumed that I could store the sticks for several weeks  I was dead wrongAfter about four weeks of storing the sticks at room temperature several of the shrinkwrapped airtight sticks started inflating like balloons This is a sign CO2 and methane being generated during decomposition The inflated sticks were discarded and the few remaining that were still in their normal shrinkwrapped state were placed in a refrigeratorAbout a week later I ate three refrigerated sticks just before heading to a venue for which I purchased tickets  This enabled me to get an exact timeline of the events which are chronicled below  Suffice it to say about four hours after eating three of the refrigerated sticks I became deathly ill  I am 99 certain the Ostrim sticks were the source of the food poisoning due to the highly controlled high protein diet at the time where every food calorie and gram of protein was being monitoredThe symptoms were so severe I thought about going to the hospital My girlfriend at the time was a physician who was able to provide some assurance that the issue was not life threatening It took about three days to recover which meant three days of zero productivity In the end a regular Ostrim consumer became someone who cringes at the very sight of the Ostrim display at my health clubTimeline of Ostrim Food PoisoningEventDateTimeOrder from Amazon2112011Package Arrived 2162011Discard of inflated decomposed  Ostrich sticks3122011Ate three Ostrich sticks3192011700 PMInitial heart burn3192011915 PMIllness begins31920111100 PMFull blown food poisoning symptoms3202011100 AMFull recovery3222011
-1,after reading al the reviews i tried this product and do not like the consistency I found that if i cook it in the microwave for a few minutes before using in recipes it is slightly more palatable this is not my favorite chicken substitute  prefer the fri chik over this product
-1,Added sugar honey corn syrup fructose and corn starch A healthy snack should not contain any of these Freshness varies too Id avoid this product
1,Tea comes out rather weak for my taste  usually have to use 2 bags for one cup  However it does greatly help to ease the stomach when strong enough  Still gets 4 stars as its the best option short of boiling actual ginger root
-1,This coconut water has a very weird smell and a bad after taste like its an old coconut  The other coconut water I have had is the Vita coco and its not bad but its better than this Zico  Zico does not taste fresh at all  If you dont breath you can drink it down  Im going to give the rest of the cartons to my mom I hope she likes it  Ewww
-1,I dont have to lose weight However I am fighting chronic candidiasis and I have to stay away from sugar all refined carbs and dairy products When I found these chocolate barswhich taste great to me I wrongly believed I had finally found the chocolates that wouldnt feed my Candida I was wrong because Maltitol does feed Candida I found out that XYLITOL is the only sweetener that does not feed the yeast Fortunately I managed to find delicious dark chocolate bars sweetened with Xylitol on the Internet and I am going to stick to those Being that Xylitol is so healthy why isnt it used on more products Unfortunately many of us already know the answer 
1,Nutmeg is rich in protective antiinflammatory compounds that can lower your risk of cancer by stifling tumor growth Macelignan the compound in nutmeg fights the germs which reduces plaque formation by 50 percent and eradicates cavityproducing microbes This is not saffron Saffron is very very expensive and comes from Iran Nutmeg is from Malaysia and Indonesia For purity place some in water If water turns into a murky color then it is diluted since real nutmeg will turn water yellow In small quantities nutmeg is safe but in higher quantities nutmeg is very poisonous and toxic Nutmeg has been used as a drug in other countries and indulgence can cause a slew of adverse effects I use it in moderation and try to get the whole nut and grind it myself In my big dishes I just throw in the nut no grinding Nutmeg has a very strong and distinctive tasteSpice Hunter is sold everywhere so prices varies considerably This is a good brand in organic form Powders always lose the taste and smell sooner than the whole nut regardless of the food item but grinding may be a challenge for such a hard nut
1,I bought both the Blueberry and Strawberry versions of these through Amazons Subscribe  Save Program I shop at Costco a lot and have been disappointed that they only carry the Frosted variety of toaster pastries I refuse to pay the grocery store prices for a treat like this so for years Ive done without Both Strawberry and Blueberry are good but I find the Blueberry to have more fruit flavor than the Strawberry Either way if youre like me youll enjoy this product and the Amazon Subscribe  Save price is quite reasonable too
1,Like it
-1,This formula came just at the time my baby had developed a bad gas habit However after trying this for a few days I gave up The first attempts seemed to reduce gas however she actively disliked the taste this is soy based versus regular milk based formulasBut I should note that I have not tried other soy based brands so Im giving this two stars instead of one
1,boo hiss  Ok the nutritional values are ok If that is your goal then go for it Coconut water is packed with electrolytes Very hydrating  If you are wondering if it will taste like your beloved coconut waternot so much It is not bad just not what I was hoping for  If you are not a person that regularly consumes fresh coconuts this may not mean much to you  I am rating a 4 because I can appreciate the strive for something healthy  On the other hand the taste just did not do it for me  Back to going ninja on the coconuts with the cleaver
-1,Kelloggs has come up with the ultimate in unhealthful snack foods with these bite size sugar fixes Sure the graham snacks are made with whole wheat but two of the most prominent ingredients are sugar and high fructose corn syrup And the buns dont taste much of cinnamon For my grocery cart these tidbits are out
-1,Its too bland for my taste it has absolutely no kick to it Not what im used to when it comes to curry i had to add some seasoning to it and heat it up longer than normal to make it thicker I think this would be my only purchase
-1,Just hated this mac and cheese So artificial yuck and made me sick in the stomach I bought a whole lot and could not eat more than two packs Gave away some to friends and neighbor kids and everyone hated it Worst mac and cheese ever Look at the ingredients and calories  not healthy either I simply wasted my money
-1,I drank this tea and within an hour needed to go to an after hours urgent care center  I have had numerous herbal teas in my life and really I get to this one and have an allergic reaction  Definately not happy now that I ordered the six pack and only went through one cup and a sip of another cup  before I started to have issues
1,I love this product It has a nutty cheesy taste And way less calories than regular cheese so I use it in the place of cheese in some recipes
1,I use only Sweet Leaf pure stevia for sweetening beverages and foods The liquid is best for cooking and for adding to cold beverages The dropper helps to measure it accurately The price through Amazon is better than that at the grocery store I will keep buying it as long as Amazon has it available The words 34Limited Quantities34 in the product listing make me wonder if it will continue to be available at Amazoncom
1,i just purchase the tea today and i already enjoy ittheres different flavor and 5 in each flavor packet this is going to last me a long long timegreat bye thank  you Lord
-1,I purchased this bargain size but it resists being mixed into a hot cup of anything resembling curdled milk or cream Since theres so much and it actually does not have the same rich mouth taste which is why I bought it to use with milk as a cheaper version of half and halfnow Im thinking as I write this that maybe if I premix this with boiled water and store it in the fridge like cream that the curdled issue will not be an issueBut otherwise sometimes it pays to spend a bit more for something known and just enjoy it
1,This was really yummy mildly spicy so that I could add hot sauce as needed and actually it was good hot or cold I love this stuff with brown basmati rice cooked in my rice cooker but I also like it with wholegrain crackers when I just dont feel like cooking
1,When I first started eating gluten free I was happy with GFs Pantrys White Bread As time went by however I started looking for more taste less crumble and more versatility I found it with Pamelas Wheat FreeGluten Free Bread Mix The addition of sorghum flour lends a honeywhole wheat taste and a nice structure to the finished product I have made beautiful baked goods with this all by hand no stand mixer including cinnamon buns yummy chewy pizza crust pie crust French bread pretzels and the BEST gluten free bagels I have ever had Its also vegan So those with dairy or egg intolerance can play with it too Amazons Subscribe and Save program makes this an affordable option that I can share with my whole family Its not just called Moms bread now
1,A good product that both tasted fantastic and was inherently healthy  The price was a nice one over what I could find in a bulk product  It has eaten well in salads morning cereals cupcakes and desert cakes  I reordered it
1,I never drank coffee and ended up with a collection of Celestial Seaonings teas in my cupboard  Until recently for whatever reason i was drinking Trader Joes peppermint teaI suppose I thought it was cheaper and it was but it always seemed weak and i would have to use two bags to get the stomachsoothing effect peppermint is known forNot so with Celestial Seasonings I started purchasing this again and it is perfect  I will never use another brand of peppermint tea
1,My kids are crazy about this stuff and sprinkle it on just about everything It adds a nice taste to popcorn rice or tofu I wouldnt be without it in my kitchen
1,Love love love this coffee I cant imagine starting my day without it The flavor is smooth not acidic at all Highly recommended
1,OK not really magic but it sure does make you feel better when you have a cold It also does wonders at soothing a sore tummyHonestly the first time I tried this drink I thought it smelled kind of funny But once I took a couple of sips the warmth of the ginger and the sweet taste of honey all combined and cleared my sinuses soothed my sore throat and made me feel really relaxed Now it just smells like ginger and honey to me and I know it will make me feel betterI also drink it when I have an upset stomach The ginger makes you feel like all your stomach muscles relax and it warms you up from the inside It settles queasiness tooBut dont just think of this as a medicinal drink Its tasty and is a great addition to my collection of tea Even when Im not feeling a cold or a stomach ache its a great way to warm up and relax
-1,Pack of 8 Campell soup listed for 5100 regular LolWhat grocery store sells them for that price They must be kidding right  Now on sale for what You can buy them in any store for a little over 100 each On sale even less Bogus PricesBogusPrices This grocery site is not for me
-1,Loved the idea of a healthy snack so gave these a try Tasty treat but WAY too much salt They are soooo salty they gave me a headache  If you are watching your sodium intake skip these little crackers  Its too bad too because otherwise they were a nice snack  Not going to purchase again
1,I got 2 cans of these cashews and used them for holiday baking  Fresh quality product  I would order again if I had the need
1,I love this stuff Tastes great I find it calming I offer it to guests who have given it positive reviews as well Yogi makes great teas and this is one of my favorites
1,I am a new Vegan so finding things that are good for me and taste really good were essential for me in my new venture as a Vegan Well Ive only had it for a week but I already have used it many times Ive used it in many fruit Smoothies at this point I really like it I can see continuing to use it for a lot of my juicing and smoothies in the future AND it tastes good
-1,Doesnt taste like real coconut water  They may have used extremely young coconuts that are are not desirable or some secondrate coconut crop
-1,This takes nothing like chocolate at all  It has a strong cinnaminnutmeg flavor that reminds me of pumpkin pie  I tried one and dont think Ill be drinking any more  As far as energy goes I do think it works   but I cant enjoy the drink enough to continue
1,My father is a second generation Italian immigrant and he had torrones since childhood In his opinion La Florrentine torrones are excellent Ill be visiting in a few days and if he hasnt eaten them all Ill try one too Believe me if my dad doesnt like something hell let me know therefore these must be good
1,Taste great for a cold coffee on the go with a healthy twist  You can also buy regular cocunut water and add a shot of expresso
-1,These sugar free thingies just must start using Stevia or Splenda else the taste like this one is barely tolerable even for just 2 cookies Maybe that is for the best but simple oatmeal cookies made with real sugar in human portions is just more healthy o and tastes superb
1,These little diamonds are great to decorate cookies at holidays or just to roll cookies in for everyday Also dont forget muffins or tea bread Works nicely
-1,When I first cut open the bag and have this miracle shiritaki noodle washed the smell of it was very mild like salmon after that I boiled it for a good 3 minutes then run it down with cold water then I put it on a flat plate to patted dry with a paper towel once it is dry I cook it with some recipes I got on YouTube  the flavor of the sauce and other stuff I cook with was good however chewing on the noodles was like biting down on a rubber band and it was difficult for me to even swallow the noodles down soon after that I threw it back up after that I threw it all the noodles away even I though I wasted my money on this noodle it is not worth trying I dont recommend it
1,I purchased these as we try to avoid white sugar  I dont know if I would purchase again due to the cost and after more research it doesnt seem the small amount we use is significant in our overall eating
1,The original Red Zinger formula had about twenty herbs and made a red soursweet minty tea that was original and popular The formula was revised maybe 20 years ago to a simpler hibiscusrose hip mix and still makes a nice red tea Various fruit essences were added such as raspberry mountain berries and now tangerine orange This is somewhat different than Mandarin Spice no cinnamon or clove and its very like Red Zinger with a slight tangerine overtone Its delicious hot but if you like juices or your kids love juice you can make up this tea to a rather strong brew chill it and mix it fiftyfifty with your juice of choice apple cranberry grape for example I dont think orange would be that good but it might who knowsThe idea is to cut the sugar of juices down and still have a refreshing cold beverage Drinking this mixed with juice will cut your sugar intake and your juice bill And its a healthy teaWe drink it all winter long keeping a hot water pot going and making big mugs of tea to stay hydrated and it even keeps you warm Sipping hot sugarfree tea keeps you from eating junk satisfies your sweet tooth and keeps you away from artificial sweeteners caffeine and other lesshealthy beverages
1,If you need help falling asleep this tea is really super Unlike many herbal teas that are 34good for you34 this tastes great For those of you familiar with Valerian it can often tastesmell funny by itself  but NOT WITH Sleepytime ExtraBeing a nurse and midwifery student who keeps odd hours this tea helps me ensure I get to sleep FAST
1,My baby was constantly gassy and fussy and someone suggested that I try this ProSobee formula  It was amazing after her next feeding with this the gassiness and the fussiness was nearly gone  This is so gentle on my babys stomach and even though it is expensive it worked so well for me
1,This is an excellent product easy to make and true to the shops most popular item  I find it very difficult to get true chocolate flavor from almost any manufactured item it always seems to be missing that deep flavor I was pleasantly surprised with Serendipity they nailed it  The cost is a little high but I dont think you could do any better pricewise at home buying all the different kinds of chocolates used  The best way to describe the flavor is  deep cocoa   Its rich and dark like hot chocolate  It tastes nothing at all like a milkshake although its is cold  The canister is a nice improvement over the pouches you get to customize the flavor a little easier  Because of the cost its a once in a while treat for us and it is a favorite  Buy with confidence its a delicious product
1,What bugout bag or backpackers pantry would be complete without powdered eggs Dont let the big can put you off either While the bigger can is ideal for you survivalist that are hording year of food that probably never get eaten in your life time the can can be opened and you can repackage in to smaller mylar zip lock bagsand customize your packaging I add powdered cheeze and milk along with freeze dried peppers and mushrooms and a pinch of garlic and pepper to my bags when I repackage for hunting and backpacking trips with that being said we do have provisions for a month in the event of a disaster this is a lot of eggs for a month so I took half of the mix and repackaged in a foodsaver bag It is sealed up air tight and once in the container with our other foods it will not be exposed to light and its shelf life should remain essentially uneffectedI have personally ate the eggsthey mix up rather well I have MY recipe for embellishing the powdered eggs down to a science When a 16 year old boy can taste the difference between these and regular scrambled eggs I must be doing something right
-1,I was very excited about this purchase until I tried this truffleThese were horrible  Maybe I got the worst bottle they have ever sold and I just happened to get them  But these are bad  If you want to eat the root of a dirty old root of a tree you will enjoy these  If you doubt my credibility of my review please feel free to read my other reviews  Please dont waste your money  My wife tried these and couldnt even believe these could be called truffles
-1,Okay people  I just dont get it  How can this stuff be getting five stars from so many people  Do they know what coffee is SUPPOSED to taste like  Yuck yuck and double YUCK  This is akin to drinking dirty water  Ive even doubled the pods to try to get a richer cupto no avail  What taste it has is horriblenot that there is much taste at all  I will struggle through this case and never buy it again  All I wanted was a cup of decaf in the afternoon or eveninga GOOD cup of decaf  Is that too much to ask  Apparently so  I wouldnt recommend this stuff to my worst enemy  Again I say YUCKAlso my tummys reaction is such that I suspect there is gluten in the packaging of the podsperhaps in the glue  I contacted Senseo to ask about it and they wouldnt give me an answer to my question unless I filled out a questionaire that would give them tons of information about ME  Forget it  That made me even more suspectI cant say for sure that there is gluten hiding somewhere  It is only a suspicion created by an all too familiar IBS reactionBuy this stuff at your own risk or if you enjoy drinking weak coffee that looks and tastes like dirty water
1,These came out to be about 150 a box  Its made of organic good stuff and without frosting  I was looking for a healthy alternative to pop tarts because I know I could take a whole box to my room and eat it all  These are really good and filling  Usually one pastry is filling and if I dont have anyone to give the second one to I end up eating the 2nd one so it doesnt go to wasteHavent tried it heated yet  Will probably buy another case or 2 before end of year
-1,Peanut butter Cookies  Yeach  the pecan shortbread cookies are so wonderful and these had 5 stars beside them so I ordered a case  nobody will eat them theyre rubbery  Im surprised because most of Pamelas products are so tastyChocolate Chunk Pecan Shortbread  These are WONDERFUL gluten free cookies  The only problem is and its a BIG PROBLEM that they were shipped in a tiny tight box and so they were all in crumbles by the time they arrived  Had Amazon packed them in a larger box and used bubble wrap OR the plastic air bags they often package with the cookies would likely not have crumbled  So disappointed because these are GOOD COOKIES
1,I am actually on my third case The product is fresh and I have it everyday What a great way to buy
-1,Im not a believer in sneaking vegetables past the children especially when the veg in question is in the form of pasta While there may technically be cauliflower in it it has none of the health benefits of eating actual cauliflower There is also less in a package than original mac and cheese and only two servings rather than three Even if the cost per package is the same that makes this product more expensive per servingCooking the very thin pasta for the six minutes directed on the package resulted in pasta well past the al dente stage I used butter rather than margarine in the preparation but otherwise made as directed with no added ingredients We got two decent sized servings from the box The resulting mixture was just ok For me the pasta had no texture and little taste only a mild cheese flavor Mrs Boilermate said she could taste the veg in the pasta and said she thought it was a good addition She thought it was less creamy than Easy Mac or the regular variety She said Stouffers Mac and Cheese was better and I agree with herOverall theres not enough here for me to like enough to purchase this product You get less per package than the regular variety in exchange for a veggie benefit thats a bit overhyped And if Mrs B is to believed one that doesnt taste as good
1,The French Vanilla is wonderful  This is our first time and it is wonderful  My wife loves flavored coffees so this was just a natural way to goWe both enjoy a coffee in the morning and one when entertaining some eveningsThese kcups are perfect for entertaining and fast perks Enjoy
-1,I was disappointed in this product  Really bland not much nutrition boring  I am going to donate the rest of my boxes to a shelter
-1,These have no taste whatsoeverno sweetness no saltiness nothing  And chewy  I nearly break my teeth trying to bite into them  I guess Im gonna have to develop a taste for them because I just bought six boxes of them   My mistake
-1,I used to have no problem with these until one day on an impulse I decided to give Targets Archer Farms brand coffee pods a try breakfast blend aka medium roast  They cost less are bigger individually wrapped and produce a much smoother coffee  Now I cant drink Douwe Egberts anymore and am hooked on Archer Farms
-1,Laced with HFCS and no real flavor  Outside of using this to maximum a subscribe and save discount I have no idea why anyone would buy this
1,I am always looking for foods that have not been altered in any way  I am delighted to find this popcorn and I tested it by cooking it in 2 tablespoons of organic coconut oil in a stainless steel Great Northern popcorn popper that has a crank to keep the kernels moving in the popper  They all popped completely and perfectly with this organic brandI also taste tested a store bought version of yellow popcorn for comparison  As far as popping completely this brand won The store version had about 9 to 12 unpopped kernels left behind using the same method There were also approximately 15 partially popped kernels left over with the store brand  There were none with this organic brand The size of the popcorn were both equal but the hulls were more noticeable with this brand yet they didnt seem to get caught in the teeth any more or less than the other  Flavor was good but not as flavorful as the store brand with nothing added to it The texture was different from the store bought version as well  It was less light and a bit more chewy in texture  Nothing that would be noticeable at all for those who like the caramel version or if you like to add salt and butter on your popcornI will be purchasing more of this brand  I was somewhat concerned about the packaging but relieved to find that it comes with its own ziplock sealer so no need to store it in something else to keep it fresh  Hope this is useful in helping you decide to purchase Enjoy
-1,I have an Indian American friend that gets free whole powdered eggs from the gov commodity program She has often made me yummyflavorfull egg sandwiches ie scrambled eggsI decided to buy some Honeyville  try it What a disappointment for scrambled eggs dont know about baking1 Their is NO flavor whatsoever2 Sticks hard to oiled stainless frying pan fried like a pancake preheated to medlow Worked better when I mixed in 1tsp of Canola oil per egg like wafflesFor 1 egg sandwich I mix 14 cup water to 14 cup mix they say 21 which was a runny mess maybe for bakingLimited shelf life I store unused mix in the freezer
-1,I love Nips and thought these would be a stronger coffee flavor version  They are not  They are flat rectangular which is not a good fit for the human mouth rock hard and nasty bitter tasting  I couldnt get through my first one and had to spit it out it was that bad
-1,because of the shape of the crystals makes it is difficult to get a even spread Some parts of your steak are saltier than others It does have a nice crunch but the taste is not so special to my buds anyway I prefer French Grey Salt for taste and since it is a fine grain it can be applied evenly Not to mention the price 17 bucks for 5 lbs delivered
-1,this is one of the worst gums I have ever had  It taste stale and old and the flavor lasts about 1 minute  warning do not purchase if you do you will be sorry
-1,I was very excited to get these Tapioca Pearls to make bubble tea They arrived a powdery blob of mess in the bag It looked like someone dropped the bag and kicked it around until it was turned into mostly dust
1,i like this one especially the throat coat seems to help a lot when you have a cold and sinus drainage and sore throat
1,this is something you need for chinese cooking and youll start finding other uses for it as you get more adventuring in your cooking
-1,When I ordered this popcorn I was expecting a premium and organic popcorn with low sodium and low fat  It was none of those  It was excessively salty and greasy and for those of you who like their popcorn with salt and butter you might like it  I prefer mine dryer where I can choose to add my own oil or butter and my own salt or none of those  I wont buy it again
1,Pamelas has done it again with the Lemon Shortbread gluten free cookie  I can hardly wait to see what is next
1,MY SON PREFERS ZICO AND I PREFER VITACOCO  Both are delicious and extremely healthy for youWhen I order I get both  My family thinks Zico is less sweet than Vitacoco and like it a tad better  It is a very close second to Vitacoco in my book  By the way each family member drinks at least two a day  These drinks have replaced soda
-1,First I wish Amazon would separate the reviews for Stash teas based on flavors rather than lumping them all together  I have the Stash Chocolate Mint Oolong tea and I really like that so I figured I would also try this so I could have a decaf chocolate tea as well  I ended up giving the rest of this away because the artificial smell and taste got to me Normally I love hazelnut and figured chocolate hazelnut would be even better  I suggest when you read the reviews on here that you check to see which flavor tea is being reviewed so that you arent mislead
-1,It comes in a very lovely box and attractive packaging but is totally funky tasting like sour milk mixed with stagnant water I am a big coconut water fan and would barely recognize this as coconut water when compared to other things I have tasted
1,Great product  keeps well enough that I can order a case and keep itin the basement Easy to chew for the kids  the 34Os34 by these folksare good too   but not as easy to chew so these are the winners of ourlittle taste test
-1,I normally love everything made by Annies and often buy the bunny grahams and fruit snacks for my grandson However I was stunned by how much I hated this mac and cheese mix Its absolutely awful the cheese sauce tastes artificial and leaves a weird aftertaste Sorry Annie but wont purchase this again I will give it one star for being organic
-1,first of all these little bunnies are delicious as the saying goes you cant eat just oneso why do i hate them because its all a lie shame bs there is more salt in these treats than in your back of potato chips more salt than SALTED PRETZELS i know because i just came from the grocery store where i checked the bags  boxesannies with their cute little bunny and hype about oh gee you can make book marks out of this box is a load of advertising hype the remaining ingredients nutrientswell i sought out this whole wheat bunny from their assortment  and only ordered it because it DOES have some fiber  organic good but the other bunnies dont  besides that there is nothing else to merit this happy dappy pile of bunnydroppingsps i just opened another box and am munching away while i type delicious
-1,I am generally a fan of mac and cheese though I typically go for the sharp cheddar variety  I dont have a big problem eating my veggies but if I can get a little extra in while enjoying some mac and cheese I figured it might be worth it  Oh my goodness but this was the most bland dish I have tasted in quite some time  The noodles seemed a little more soft than those to which I am accustomed and there was just no real taste at all to the sauce  After a couple of bites I spent some quality time in front of my spice rack and finally came away with something I was willing to eatSo if you are on a soft bland diet and you need to get in more veggies then I guess I could recommend this  But if you are able just stick with your usual mac and cheese and add a salad  You will get more veggies and your taste buds will thank you
-1,I was really excited to try these lollies Dont be Most of the flavors taste nothing like their names They are overpriced and extremely poorly packaged If you think you are going to get some nice thing like the picture shows GUESS AGAIN  They arrive dumped in a plastic bag which has been dumped in a box and dropped from a great height For the kind of shipping they want it would be reasonable to expect a better presentation These do last for a long time which isnt really a plus since the flavors are nasty If only they could get together with the people that make Jelly Belly and get some flavoring from them
1,This is great for hungry kids to heat up anytime My two are only 10  11 and they have been using the microwave for a couple of years This is also great to send off with your college student They might need a quick meal on those late study nights
-1,The bar had many nutritional pluses  Sadly it lacked at least for me the one thing I require  taste  I also thought the texture was undesirable  I wont be buying any more
-1,Wow was I looking forward to this after the great reviews I got it today  made a cup right away What a huge disappointment The cinnamon oil is overpowering in a very unpleasant way I cannot taste or smell any other spice The green tea does come through a bitI forced myself to finish the cup I doctored it with extra fresh cardemom and fresh star anise It was not worth the effort it was as if Id never put them in the cupIf you like true chai flavored tea and do not want the cinnamon to overpower your taste buds this is NOT for you Stay away from this stuffEven from the perspective of the cinnamon flavor this tea is not pleasant I understand cinnamon is good for lowering blood sugar levels so if you want to use this as a medicinal tea I guess this would be acceptableI cant send this back so Ill be using it in a pot of boiling water for a cinnamon potpourri I wouldnt even mix it with my other chai teas as there is just too much cinnamon oilStash would have been better off just using the real spices and skipping the oils Now I am concerned about the green tea chai from Stash I have some on order and they noted that they included clove oil Im hoping it wont taste like a cup of clove waterVery very disappointed
-1,These Thin bars are unfortunately pretty much what you would expect from something like this  Small flavorless for the most part or at least carrying an off flavor and only satisfying in the sense that you know its better for you than a Twinkie  I really didnt get any real chocolate fudge flavor out of these at all  They really dont taste bad just not satisfying or all that pleasant  They do the trick as far as having something in your tummy and putting off hunger pangs for a little while but thats about it  One thing I did like about them is the chewy texture  It was rather gummy to me in that sense which is something you either like in these things or not I do for it gives you the sense of this small bar lasting a little longerMy biggest gripe with these is the cost  None of these proteindiet type bars are cheap but these are definitely on the high end for sure And there is no flavor there to account for the bigger bucks You can do better here as far as taste and price  The specs on these are pretty good for those that are really trying to lose weight or snack healthier but I see no reason to recommend them otherwise
-1,Normally I love love love this product but it tasted odd and I ended up throwing it all away I wont order it again
-1,When I was incarcerated in a Mexican prison this was the only drink in the joint We had to fix it with goats milk and heat it over an open flame in the yard The taste is awful Its not pleasing like the thick hot Chocolate found in Madrid
1,The GURU Natural Energy Drink crafted with organic ingredients is a small 84oz can which tastes best ice cold but is good at room temperature as wellIngredients on my cans are listed as Sparkling water organic cane syrup organic white grape juice concentrate natural flavors apple acid citric acid organic green tea extract guarana seed extract organic echinacea flower extract organic panax ginseng root extract notice the product screen shots and description and you will find some differences even between screen shots of canContains 100mg of naturally occurring caffeine per serving100 calorie 0 fat 0 sodium 25mg sugar one of the product can shots lists salt and 5mg sodium mine had noneThe flavor of some energy boost drinks is tolerable if you know you are getting a benefit but this one tastes good on its own In this case you will have to justify the cost for the boost as the taste alone doesnt quite justify the cost to me in such a small can
-1,There is no smoke or burger taste at all in this This was a big let down  There is an overwhelming bean taste Reminds me of Hot dog chili without the chili powder The texture is the same as chili Not solid enough to cut and fry I tried  So the  only use for this is chili or no meat sauceIf you want a burger or burger sub then do not buyShould call it redi ground
1,I was afraid this might be too spicy but its not I just started using this a couple days ago and have added it to BBQ chicken I made in the crockpot
1,The booties are so good that I decided to subscribe to get one package every two months from Amazon I had to speed up the next shipment because my kids and I devoured the whole content of the initial shipment in less than a month Stay away if you do not like addiction
1,Unfortunately Im totally addicted to these sticks because I just got tired of the twists  These have the right size and  crunch for me
-1,I have tried my fair share of protein bars and they all seem to taste like powdery chalk  This high protein bar by Think Thin is not an exception  The flavor is chocolate fudge and while there is an element of chocolate it is mired with a bitter aftertaste that is prelude by powdery chalk aspect that haunts my palate  This protein bar is designed to be a meal replacement hence the calorie count of 240 and a total fat count of 8 grams  I would imagine that if a person is willing to sacrifice the calories and fat this meal replacement bar should taste better  In addition this protein bar has cholesterol in it which I found quite disappointing  There is no sugar or trans fat in this bar but cholesterol  I believe I will continue using homemade smoothies as my meal replacement
-1,Texas Pete is very average  It has too much of a peppery taste and isnt really that hot  In fact I would describe the overall flavor as bland not tasty at all  I have tried a lot of hot sauces and while Texas Pete is not bad it leaves me a little flat
-1,From a GlutenFree subscriber Oh dear I ordered this from Amazon because it is a dollar less per box than in the Martins store in their glutenfree aisle and these are the best chocolate GF cookies we have ever eaten BUT The cookies arrived totally broken into very small pieces and loads of crumbs Guess they would be great for a pie crust tho What a dissapointment They are somewhat tender to begin with and I dont know how Amazon can package them in a special way to prevent such destruction We all know how packages are treated by the carriers who deliver themnot delicately thats for sure So will never order these by mail again and must pay the exorbitent price the go for at Martins Pooh
-1,I recently purchased one of these from my local supermarket I thought the flavor of the box version of zico was ok so I figured they just redesigned their packageBoy was I wrongI took a sip and as fast as the liquid entered my mouth it also left the other way Yuck It tastes like really sugary old coconuts I then looked at the ingredients and see premium coconut water from concentrate natural flavorsI just dont get it Why would they go from using fresh coconut water in their box version to concentrated coconut water in this not very environmental friendly plastic bottleand charge more for it Am I missing somethingThe taste is horrible and I really wish they would go back to their original formulation There are enough pure coconut water products like vita coco one on the market so why settle for something from concentrate pay more for it and hurt the planet with more plastic
1,On a sultry July morning a few years before Katrina blew into town a friend and I wandered into the frenetic powdersugar dusted Cafe du Monde for an early cup of coffee and the famously fabulous fritters we had heard so much about We were hot sweaty and more than a little worn out from having hoofed all over the historic district It would take more than a few Dunkin Donuts to revive our exausted jaded spirits and a whole lot more than a Krispee Kream to skewer our skepticismThe pastries needed to be fresh hot and Parispretty to impress us The coffee had to be perfectly percolated to perk us upWhat we had that morning several plates of steaming sinfullysweet preciselypowdered beignets were tiny pillows of pastry perfection The beignets were so good we made several more early morning trips to Cafe du Monde during our stay in New Orleans The coffee was utterly addictive strong lovely fullbodied with a rich aroma that could be detected long before we entered the shopOnce home I experienced a serious postperfectbeignet letdown Krispee Kream no longer cut it Starbucks was sadly unsatisfyingI was thrilled when I discovered I could buy Cafe du Mondes beignet mix and coffeee online I ordered several boxes and cans stocked up on a truckload of powdered sugar and anxiously waited by my mailbox When the muchcoveted beignet mix was finally delivered I wasted no time in firing up the oil and brewing a pot of coffeeI was very pleased with the beignet mix and the chicory coffee The directions were easy to follow just add water and the amount of mix in the box was generous for the price Once properlly prepared the beignets were just as delicious as those served at Cafe du Monde of course you do have that tiresome cleanup when you make them at home that you dont have when you go to the cafe in New Orleans but all truly great things come with a pricePefect patries and heavenly coffee  Forget Starbucks
-1,This soup would be more rightly called FISH SOUP rather than miso soup  It has miso listed as one of the ingredients but the BONITO fish overpowers everything else  Although I like fish I really hate this soup and I feel cheated by the money I spent on it
1,Pros Couging a lot This helps to calm the cough and perhaps the moisture is a bit of an expectorant Works well for meGreat flavor with the lemon dont have to add anythingCons Cost
-1,These might be OK for hiprotein pretzels but they are not so good as pretzels period In addition the bags I received will expire in less than 3 months I am not pleased
1,Ive used Filippo Berio extra virgin olive oil for years  Ive tried other more costly EVOs to see if I found one I liked better but I didnt  I like Berio best It has great mouth feel and taste and that peppery bite one expects from a good EVO
1,I hesitated but then still decided for this to be the only product that I ever took a star from for being too good Too good to the point of being addictive I know sugar can be addictive anyway But this chewy candy provided you like the taste of condensed milk is insanely so If they ever produce a version with stevia or xylitol to make it less unhealthy Ill give it ten starsIn the meantime you might also want to check outHigh Concentrated Milk Hard Candy Japanese Import The hard candy consistency takes some of the addictiveness away
1,I suggest starting this tea a few days before your cycle and continue a few days afterward The taste is not awesome but it did seem to help
-1,I didnt like this jerky at all  I read other reviews and decided to try it  However the bag I received was very soft and sweet  I realize that its called sweet n spicy but it wasnt spicy at all  The sweetness was overpowering  I prefer at dryer jerky also  This was so soft that you could bite right through it  Im used to jerky that is tougherI know Ill never purchase this brand again
-1,Not so good Youre better off buying any other cashews Dry small and taste oddCan NOT recommend
-1,If you are looking for a Kona blend that actually tastes like a Kona blend pass this one by  Maybe it sat next to a bag of Kona in the warehouse but thats about as close as it comesKona is smooth and never bitter  This stuff just tastes like an ordinary slightly bitter medium roast coffee  Wont be buying this again
-1,I usually love these cheese and peanut butter crackers but these are probably the worst Ive ever had The peanut butter was stale tasting and the crackers greasy and mushy I dont know if these were just old I couldnt find a date on the package or if the Keebler product just isnt as good as other brands but Ill never buy these again Ill stick to the Lance or Austin brands for future purchases
1,Very good cereal These rice puffs are made from brown rice thus better for you than white rice puffs Also O sodium Glad I tried them
1,Loved the quick and satisfying taste of this product made me feel like I was at my kitchen table back home Thanks for your prompt shipping and support
1,This tea is very heartydefinitely double in spicy chai flavor  I recommend it to anyone who likes a stronger tea And you cant beat the deal especially with the Prime program  save a couple of dollars  free shipping  Add a little sweetner and cream and it really enhances the flavors
1,Maseca Corn Flour 44 lbsis the real thing for making delicious tortillas  The only other ingredient necessary is water Of course a huge amount of technique is required  My soninlaw uses it to thicken his wonderful chili  He gave me the recipe which I placed in Flavored with Love Mary Lous Family and Friends Can Cook  Hes such a nice soninlaw  He would not want me to tell you this but he is a great cookMaseca Corn Flour is made from ground dried corn It can be used to make masa harina dough for tortillas sopes and empanadas enchiladas pupusas guaraches arepas and atole the manufacturer says It is gluten freeThe manufacturer the Gruma company has been making this fine corn flour for over 50 years
1,I hate instant mashed potatoes and despite the label saying 100 real I was skeptical when my friend was making these for a group dinner  Since then Ive been using them and found this amazing deal on Amazon
-1,I thot shortbread with lemon sounded yummy  Not the casetaste of lemon overwhelming too strong for me plus the taste was slightly chemical  sure didnt taste shortbread
-1,I must say that I am a fan of gingersnap cookies I love the combination of crunch and ginger While these had a definite ginger flavor they were very soft and that was a bit of a turnoff for me I do like gingerbread cookies but these didnt seem sweet enough for my taste and the almonds seemed a bit out of place
1,I bought a box of these on impulse at my local grocery store and they sat in the pantry until the day came that I needed a side dish that wouldnt take much time to prepare  My family loved them  Im sure they are not as good as the real thing having never actually mashed sweet potatoes but for a quick side we found them to be yummy and nicely seasoned
1,This flour is amazing Ive used brown rice flour in my glutenfree baking for years This particular one is so finely ground theres no typical grit at all in the final product I never even knew any rice flour could be this soft and smoothIf you bake with rice flours this one gives a nice smooth final product but still gives you the flavor and slight protein benefits of brown rice
-1,I figured sooner or later there would be a Tazo tea I did not like  It has an overly sweet artificial taste to it  I got past the blood red color and really wanted to like this tea  Will be giving this to a friend who may like it more  Luckily I only paid 299 for a box of 20 at my local Homegoods who had lots of Tazo Mightly Leaf and other brands on display from 299  599
-1,I only tried this 1st time but this didnt cook well compared to boiling maybe I didnt follow instructions but the macaronis are very tiny much tinier than normal  Sauce didnt mix well So the combination not worth it I assume this applies to all flavors
-1,Since this was the only Bear Naked Granola on the store shelf that did NOT contain Canola Oil which Im very allergic to it was the only one I could use my coupon on  Maybe the other Bear Naked varietiesBear Naked All Natural Granola Fruit and Nut  12Ounce Pouches Pack of 6Bear Naked All Natural Granola Peak Protein 12Ounce Pouches Pack of 6Bear Naked Fit Vanilla Almond Crunch Granola 12Ounce Pouches Pack of 6Bear Naked All Natural Granola Banana Nut 12Ounce Pouches Pack of 6Bear Naked 100 Pure  Natural Granola Maple Pecan 12Ounce Pouches Pack of 6Bear Naked 100 Pure  Natural Granola Peak Flax Oats  Honey with Blueberries 12Ounce Pouches Pack of 6 andBear Naked Granola Heavenly Chocolate 12Ounce Pouches Pack of 6 taste better but I found this product unpleasant with a foul aftertaste coming from the freeze dried berriesI recommend theBack To Nature Oat Vanilla Almond Agave Granola 12Ounce Pack of 3instead
-1,Hey Progresso Is there a ham crisis I noticed that you guys were VERY chinzy on the ham in your split pea soup The chunks were small and REALLY dried out  and lacking flavorWhoever was  is the mastermind behind this new socalled recipe should be ashamed Your OTHER stuff is great but this split pea with ham is an embarrassment to your good nameProgresso  Youve spent DECADES building a solid reputationWhy blow it for a few lousy pieces of HAM  and a few idiots who clearly have no idea how to make YOUR SOUP 
-1,The Spelt product listing States it is wheat freeThe box of product received today states Contains Wheat and Manufactured on equipment that processes products containing wheatThe bag artwork doesnt match the Amazon product photoThose of us with wheat allergies are not happy with this productPhotos posted
-1,Too sweet I dont know why but it is Its just not quite right It could be due to the fact that its sugar free and in the quest to replicate a sugar based product they overcompensated Not sure but it will take me months to finish this if I finish it
1,In todays landscape you might be arrested for child abuse But back in the early 60s we thoughts puffing on these was the greatestoh simpler times Im a nonsmoker and very antismoking btw I gave these as a joke gift to a friend on her 55th birthday to remind her of those old times The only reason Im giving them 4 stars is because they dont taste the way I remember and dont give off a puff of 34smoke34 which I think was powdered sugar they were coated with way back when I dont think any adult is going to eat these as candy and youre unlikely to give them to kids But as a joke gift theyre fine
-1,Ive had quite a few of these bars in my bag as I travel  the Clif Protein bars are the top with a couple of the Atkins varieties slightly below and this one near the very bottom Theyre sold under the auspices of healthy  that halo effect from the gluten free but theyre really just a not very good candy barPros No sugar so if youre low carb theyll work Um theyre larger than some of the teeny tiny bars so thats goodCons They taste pretty terrible Flavors of wet cardboard stale beer and old cigarette butts meld with that something youll find on the floor at a fraternity house Theyre not good for you Just eat a candy bar instead seriously
-1,I suppose if you are a big fan of dates you might like this thing because thats all it tastes like  No chocolate flavor  No coconut flavorIll eat them all because I paid for them but I wont buy anything else from this companyI gave it two stars because its not bad for you not the same as good for youLater  Okay Ive eaten the whole box and they kind of grow on you  If you really like dates youll really like this bar  But I still wont buy them again
1,I know the description talks more about nuts etc but this stuff is actually seriously CHOCOLATE  Its a creamy fudgy chocolate spread with a hazelnut flavor think fudge spiked with hazelnut liqueur  Its incredibly rich  a little really goes a long way  I usually just spread it on graham crackers for a wonderful indulgent treatIm hooked  this will be in my pantry from now on  No refrigeration necessary  how convenient is that
1,This is a bit thicker than other formulas and can cause some constipation so for best results I am mixing it with regular enfamil It works for spit up but youre going to have to use bigger nipples and make some adjustments for feeding Id ease this into your babys diet so that its not a sudden change It works great though if you have a baby who spits up a lot
-1,i guess that i was expecting something chunkierit tastes like salty mush to me  i started adding it to big pots of chili to try to use it up
1,My Favorite KnorrLipton Flavor of all the Sides This flavor with the cheddar and broccoli is so so so good And love the fact that it tastes so cheesy and also has broccoli in it This makes a quick meal for one or two For me I eat it as a regular meal and eat the whole package by myself as it is that goodHighly recommend this product
1,As soon and I opened one of these little gems I was transported back to my childhood when I spent my summers with my beloved NonnaMy grandma had a store in Bridgeport Ct I loved going there It was one of those stores that had a grocery department in the front  and in the back was a butcher there was saw dust on the floor and fish and hardware splattered around on the counter my grandma would keep under the rows of Italian sausage and big balls of aging chees a basket full of Perugino nougat candy just like this one Although these are not the same brand the are good enough to bring back fond memories of my times with my grandmaI would come in and call out Ciao Nonna and she would come and kiss my cheep and grab a couple of candies tell me how much she loved me and tap my bottom and send me on my way with my treatI just cannot stop eating these they are not exactly like the ones I remember because it has been a very long time and tastes have changed but these are just as soft and sweet chewy and still has nice crispy almonds  If the almonds are stale they would be soft and chewy not good  I love these I am just happy they do not sell them around the corner I would be in troubleIf you have never tried this unbelievable nougat candy you are missing something give them a try you will not be sorry
-1,This stuff is just a powdery waste of money I wont buy it again ever Youd do better with packets of swiss miss
-1,While the flavour of this gum is nice I agree with other reviewers who say the flavour doesnt last very long Not only that but the pieces are quite small so you have to chew 2 or 3 of them to really get any flavour Disappointing
-1,I dont like this tea compared to other Yogi teas  The taste is a missmash of flavors kind of likedrinking something that was made of a bunch of leftover teas  Wont buy it again  I like theirChai Black much better although it does have caffeine whereas this one only has 5 mg per teabag I think
1,The tea is delicious but I havent experience the 34runs34 as mentioned by other reviewers  even when I let it steep for a long period I have over a period of a week found myself to be more regular Overall I like the product and will continue to use it to promote regularity Maybe being more regular will get that scale moving downward again
-1,Perhaps the best coffee is in the US if this is any example  Not really fond of chickory but felt it was worth the try  Doesnt taste like coffee to me  but maybe should be called something else  something weak and not flavorful
1,A bit pricey but a little goes a long way  And the colors provided can be combined to make any color your little heart desires  Cool if youre into cake decorating
-1,Honestly havent tried them yetbut my aunt pointed out that their ingredients looks quite dangerous and resemble those in other foods high in GMOsIngredientsWater Wheat Gluten Red Beans Tomato Paste Tomatoes Salt Soybean Oil Contains 2 or less of Salt Modified Corn Starch Onion Dried Hydrolyzed Soy Protein Corn Protein and Wheat Gluten Sugar Monosodium Glutamate Caramel Color Autolyzed Yeast Extract Garlic Powder Corn Syrup Dextrose Spices Natural Flavors From Nonmeat Sources Vitamins and Minerals Niacinamide Iron Ferrous Sulfate Vitamin B1 Thiamin Mononitrate Vitamin B6 Pyridoxine Hydrochloride Vitamin B2 Riboflavin Vitamin B12 Cyanocobalamin Paprika Extract Corn Oil
-1,Kraft Foods owner of Bakers Chocolate just DOUBLED the price of this product There is no justification for this dramatic price increase other than pure greed This item as listed costs 4 per box That is about 70 more than it sold for in the grovery store just a few months ago before the price increase The price increase by the way came in the way of reducing the chocolate blocks to half of their original size I recommend that you boycott and not purchase Bakers Chocolate in protestEdit If the actual cost were 47 cents per ounce that would be a good deal But with the 495 shipping fee the cost per ounce becomes 62 cents per ounce 1995 divided by 32 ounces which is not a good deal at all The price at the store typically runs about 59 centsoz
-1,This stuff works to get rid of bloating but the taste is horrible It is very bitter so I would use stevia or honey to help with the taste
-1,These are definitely not flakes but more like granulated yeast Make sure you read the product description before buying this product Carpe diem
-1,I have been consistently disappointed in the various Lavazza blends that I have tried  My last hoteltravel interface with poor quality ground Lavazza pods has resulted in a new addition to my cosmetic bag a little Ziplock full of Senseo brand pods which are decent if not superlative fairly common in stores and will accomodate many coffee coffee makers  I thought the last Lavazza incident was just a bad batch but its statistically unlikely that it should keep happening every time  If you have had better luck with specific blends bless you but I think its not my crappy Karma but their crummy coffee  Just my two cents your mileage may vary  I use coffee to pry open the eyelids and I need to hit the ground running so the first cup has to be acceptable  Life is to short to drink dishwatery coffeeSenseo Douwe Egberts Coffee Pods Variety Pack 16Count Packages Pack of 4
-1,The Senseo pods are no longer a cost effective way of getting a quality cup of coffee Looking through my order history Back in the day a couple of years back this six pack of 18 pods used to hover around eighteen bucks now it is double that So I got curious and I cut a pod and compared it against the content of a K Cup  the Senseo pod contains about half the coffee of a regular KCup This means one has to use two Senseo pods to match the strength of a KCup for the same size brew This translates to Senseo being more expensive than an average K Cup bought in quantity here at AmazonMaybe I got used to the coffee but the Senseo pods no longer produce the bold aroma and taste that got me hooked a few years back I defected to Keurig where I found a much richer variety and I dont regret it for a second On the contrary I stopped having this nagging feeling of being ripped off by the constantly increasing price of these pods
1,As a previous reviewer said I found I needed to cook it at least two minutes more than recommended  Otherwise it is not very tender and is gummy  I am really not a fan of powdered cheese but the kids really like Annies so I guess well stick with it until its not offered on Subscribe and Save anymore
-1,Not what I thought it would be  Not to my liking taste bland hard to cook as you dont know how much water to use I thought it was p remade  all you had to do is warm it up
-1,This is definitely a kidfriendly supereasy open and heat product Easy to serve and usually welcomed with excitement by the under7 set based on looks alone BUT if you think these are a superhealthy option just because they are organic youre definitely kidding yourself Organic or not this is still stuffed with sodium and preservatives albeit of the more natural varietyit is after all canned precooked food Better than a trip through the McDonalds drive thru Id say yeah probably especially with a vegetable side Healthier than just about any other nonprepackaged pasta option organic or otherwise Umm not likelyAs for taste the reviewer who called these pasta in tomato soup just about nailed the flavor profile though the mushy pasta wasnt pointed out perhaps implied Honestly in the one time we tried these when my fouryearold was left with a babysitter that I dont really want to ask to cook anything he was excited at first but then barely ate anyIn general I think Annies tends to make tasty convenient products that are a healthier note I didnt say healthy choice than similar products but this one seems like a miss If you must have processed convenience food on handand cmon I do my best but were all human and busyI think there are plenty of tastier and more nutritious options out there including other Annies Organics products
1,Do you like snacks with heat That are also pretty healthy for you If so try thisPlanters peanuts are a staple in our family This is a Planters product that ups the ante The ingredient list is somewhat vague but chili pepper is on that list And boy does one get a sense of that when eating this product Many products claim to be spicey biut are bland as all get out This aint bland The heat is real and that makes this peanut product a lot of funSo if you want a fairly healthy diet with a kick try this   
-1,I was optimistic about the flavor based on the yummy soy sauce and sesame aroma coming from the finished product But the taste oh man the taste It tasted like pure vinegar The sauce was SO SOUR The acidity overpowered any soy or sesame flavor by a long shot The only thing I can think is that in order to compensate for the dish being lower sodium than most noodle bowl type things they tried to ramp up the flavor with acidic ingredients A touch of acidity does help bring out the flavor when you reduce the salt but this was WAY too much
-1,I love yogi tea pretty much every flavor I have tried  This tea tastes good but I have had no detox effects with this one  Ive used the berry detox and that one really works well so Im not sure why this tea is not the same  If you dont care about the detox part the flavor is very pleasant and mild
1,I give the product 5 stars  These peanuts have always been my favorite  The price with subscribe and save is terrific especially when there is a coupon available  My peanuts came fresh and well packages  My biggest issue with these is they are so good that I can not eat just 1 serving or 2 for that matter  So 1 star for my willpower and 5 stars for the peanuts
1,Celestial seasoning has the best Chai in my opinon  A bit cheaper at Wallmart now but you cant always get it as they are lousy restocking  or something  The decaf is good also though not quite as strong I think almost
-1,ALTHOUGH I RECEIVED MY SHIPMENT IN A TIMELY MANNER I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE PRODUCT  IT TASTES LIKE INSTANT NONFAT DRY MILK AND NOTHING LIKE SOUR CREAM  IT MAY BE OK TO USE IN COOKING BUT NOT ON BAKED POTATOES  ALSO IT DOES NOT COME WITH DIRECTIONS  IF I COULD I WOULD GIVE IT MINUS 5 STARS THATS HOW DISAPPOINTED I AM  THE COMPANY MAY BE GOOD AND THEIR OTHER PRODUCTS MAY BE GOOD BUT NOT THE SOUR CREAM POWDER
1,TASTE Okay Tasted more flavorful brands but acceptableAPPLICATION Its true that this is finely ground However being careful and keeping the container close to the platepan  you can apply it in your desired amount without any mess
-1,The packets I received show some form of stevia as the primary ingredient but the box shows xylitol first I would much prefer having more stevia as xylitol upsets my stomach after a while The taste of these is okay but I feel cheated by the change in formulation the conflicting labels and the companys lack of response when I called them last week for clarification
1,Im not a cereal eater but my husband is and he ate this up like it was going out of style  He enjoyed it immensely  the bags are large and generously filled for long lasting  The taste and flavor are wonderful and I will be ordering it again
1,My mom takes fenugreek seed daily to control her blood sugar level It works well and she has been able to reduce her dosage of GlucophageThe use of fenugreek for treating diabetes has been scientifically validated you can read abstracts by doing a keyword search on  My mom gets it from the Indian grocer where it is much cheaper though loose and not encapsulated
1,We usually eat a mixture of cereals in the morning  a little bit of a sweet cereal like Cinnamon Chex or Panda Puffs a few nuts andor raisins and then fill the rest of the bowl with Mesa Sunrise  Very tasty and good for you  Ordering it by the case at amazoncom is much cheaper and easier than bringing it all home from the store each week  Its like having the mailman do my shopping for me  Highly recommend
1,As expected these are delicious and hard to stop eating  I have them on my subscription list so get a 15 discout besides  They are a nice treat or a quick hostess gift if needed  This is a great way to get them and they are just what the can shows but there are options for other nuts also
-1,Sorry Knorr I usually am a HUGE fan of your productsNot so hereThere is something that just tastes very fake in these noodles  and it truly tastes like there is something missing tooVERY strange flavor Absolutely WILL NOT be purchasing this products again NO WAY Some of the other items in this line are fantastic but this one is a zip in our books
1,Only salt I can have on my weight loss plan  And yes it is the only REAL Salt all other salts have been processed or iodized and are not considered natural salt  Better for you and tastes the same
-1,I agree with the review about the strange taste  I LOVE LOVE Black Jewell NATURAL flavor popcorn so I decided to try the Butter one It popped up fine but it just has a weird taste  Even my popcorn loving 12yr old said something was wrong with the flavor  I ordered 6 boxesdont know what I am going to do with the 5 boxes leftmaybe donate  I will continue to buy the Natural by the case and butter it myself
-1,We are allergic to corn starch and though the Annie Chun peanut noodle bowl has none as do the Udon and Miso soups this DOES have corn starch  If you are allergic or sensitive to corn do not order this product  The corn is not listed but believe me it is there and once you get your package you will see it on the label
1,Get your Popcorn when a Movie is on or a music concert is on your tvive been down with Orville redenbachers popcorn for the longest time i do like mine with extra butter but this is cool and it pops  really well real tasty
-1,I generally enjoy strong flavors but this spice mix ruined a seafood lasagna I made a few months ago Perhaps it would be OK on chicken but the lemon was overpowering and very unpleasant in the lasagna For the first time in my 50 years of living I have thrown out a jar of spice as I cannot use it the lemon is yucky and seems very artificial Real lemon would not be anywhere near as intense There are many much better spice mixes available including other Mrs Dash products but they are greatly overpriced
1,I just love this stuffbest coffee ever  Smooth strong rich and stands up to being made into iced coffee andor with creamers  Very robust with a deep flavor
1,Bought this because we have to watch the sodium  This tastes EXACTLY like soy sauce but with a fraction of the sodium and its better for you  We actually use instead of salt on about anything  I had this in a bottle with a 34drip34 top the spray top is REALLY awesome cause it mists all over  Would I recommend this  TOTALLY
1,Just do a search for the latest exhaustive studies done of all the top imports and a few great california brands  including BarianiMost all of the imports were oxidized and adulterated  a few of the california most expenside were a bit off too But this and California Olive ranch were tops
1,My family has always used Old Bay Seasoning for steaming crabs and shrimp and I also add a small amount to other fish dishes  A few years ago however I discovered what would be my favorite use for itpotato saladI have never liked deli potato salad and am pretty picky about homemade  My sisterinlaw made some for a party and it was the best I had ever eaten  I asked her what her secret was and she ran down the usual list of potato salad ingredients  Then she told me she added Old Bay Seasoning  Bingo  That was itI went straight home and made my homemade potato salad grabbed my can of Old Bay and sprinkled away  I cant say exactly how much I use because I never measure ingredients when Im making my own recipes  Just add some stir it up and tasteadd some stir it up and taste till you like it  The seasoning does not overpower the salad flavor at all just enhances it  Dont be concerned that there is going to be a crab or shrimp taste to your salad it isnt the Old Bay that makes crabs and shrimp taste like seafood  Old Bay just makes seafood taste better and now potato salad too  Try it on your homemade potato salad I think youll love it
-1,This tastes more like vegetable base than lobster base It will work in a pinch and it doesnt taste bad but even fish sauce tastes better than this if you were looking for something closer to a lobster flavor plus it is far less expensive if you went to an Asian store It is way too pricey than it should be and is why 2 stars With its shell I think the crustacean escaped the bouillon pot
-1,I know what Ginger tastes like and this is NOT Ginger The only things I found pleasant about this tea is that it came in a beautiful box and the individual packs were nicely packaged I dont care whether this is organic or not the flavor of Ginger is absolutely absent If you appreciate the aroma and strong flavor of good cup of Ginger tea then try Prince of Peace Honey Ginger Crystals The aroma lights up the room the flavor is strong and authentic and since they are crystals there are no tea bags to deal with and the result is a good clean cup of genuine Ginger tea
1,I personally prefer Neutrogena foot cream for desert dry feet but this is a rare find for the amount of Aloe and is what granny prefers no one that I can find still sells a 100 cream for serious desert dry AND aged skin Most creams are watered down today for casual use but that stuff does nothing for where its often below 4 humidity And I was able to buy it here for much less Recommended
-1,straight off these teabags smelled 34different34 than the stash and twinings we were used to in our house  I made this for both my mother and daughter both lifelong tea drinkers and neither of them liked it  my daughter thought it was so bad she poured it out after one small sip while my mother managed to get down less than half a cup  this is not the red robust tea I was expecting but instead was a muddy brown so its back to stash for us
1,I am a big fan of Yogi tea They make great stuff Always very high quality ingredients very tasty blends This is one of the 5star varieties Although it lists itself as chamomile and lavender the flavor is predominantly a nice licorice which combined with the other ingredients is more like anise It is also a moderately sweet tea Id call this a rich and fullbodied herbal tea And although Im not a big traditional remedy person there do seem to be some real benefits to this and Relaxed Mind However it might be as much due to the enjoyment of a nice hot flavorful cup of tea as it is due to the herbs in the teaEither way the tea is full of flavor and relaxing Enjoy
-1,I bought this coffee expecting a dark roast to use in my espresso machine  I know its an italian roast but its much more medium to light than other italian roasts Ive had  The color of the beans is similar to the top of the bag a medium brown not oily at all in fact they look completely dry  Whether this is normal or not for this roast I dont knowAll the other italian and darkfullbodied roasts Ive had have been much darker bordering on blackish and have at least some oil on the bean surfaceThis coffee brews extremely light as an espresso  Id say its nutty and a bit sweet as well Lacks depth  complexity  It is smooth but so is water  There are no of those darkerroast flavors smoky chocolate toast etc or heartinessIf youre a fan of espresso french roast sumatra and other bolddarkroasts this coffee is not for you  I wish I could return this
-1,Buyer Beware Please  This sweetner is not for everybody Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience Nausea diarrhea  headaches can also be experienced I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugarfree chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell I thought Id found sugarfree chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping As the symptoms passed this too was very unpleasant Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetner could be the culprit all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugarfree popcorn at my local market The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy new sugarfree treat taste so good my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetner down to the very bottom of the label and read maltitol in tiny little letters Thank goodness Id eaten only a little  I still ended up with all the same sideeffects but for a much shorter duration Some people can use maltitol to their hearts content but others like me can have a bad reaction to it In case youre like me  its not you  its the maltitol
-1,Admittedly I like pure vanilla flavor and I was expecting this to have quite a bit of vanilla  after all its not called rooibos vanilla  the vanilla came first in the name therefore I want vanilla to be the high note  Well it isnt its more of an afterthought and quite honestly it went in the trash  I usually like Celestial Seasonings but this one definitely didnt do it for me
-1,I was very excited to try these but it is either this is not a very quality product or I just dont get itthe mushroom had no taste I made myself one serving of a creambased sauce for farina spaghetti and shredded this mushroom in itit offered zero taste
1,As Ive gotten into new recipes over the last year I find myself using sour cream a lot more often than I used to While I can get locally made sour cream fairly easily the weather doesnt always allow it This powder is a great way to have sour cream on hand especially if you dont buy it that often
1,I have two Maltese dogs and was at my wits end when I found this product  The people behind me had brought in two puppies covered with ticks and promptly shared them with the entire neighborhood  Nocturnal visits by cats plus several squirrels running around in my yard brought in fleas and I could NOT get rid of them  Maltese dogs have really long thick hair and my poor little dogs were just miserable  I had to have all their hair cut off which I usually do in the summer in the early spring while it was still very cold at night and in the morning  And I STILL couldnt get rid of the fleas and ticks  My male dog is allergic to Advantix and Frontline didnt even slow the ticks down  So I was looking for some other kind of help when I found this product  I had heard some people say it worked and others said it didnt but I decided it was worth a try and Im really glad I tried it  It doesnt get rid of every flea or tick on my dogs but where I was finding a bunch of fleas and picking ticks off my dogs by the dozens every day I am now finding an occasional flea and maybe one or two ticks on my dogs every day  My little girl dog is a big eater and she loves to eat her pill  My finickyeater boy has to have his crushed and dropped into his mouth  Once its there he likes it pretty well and will go ahead and swallow it  Bottom line  it worked pretty well for my dogs and there is no garlic smell that I can detect  I think it was well worth the money
-1,This product contains GMOs Known to cause Cancer and Organ Failure Im sorry but I will not be feeding my family your cereal anymore until you use safer ingredients Shame on you
1,In reading the reviews I am surprised that the appearance of this dish is repeatedly mentioned I didnt notice what some other reviewers view as a disgusting appearance Perhaps it is because my first experience with this product was a few years ago in a food sampling Small cup not a big plateful and I focused on the intense flavors and the fact that the base is spinach  something I love and dont consume enoughEveryone is entitled to their opinion but I adore this dish The smell is distinctive  decidedly earthy which I relish The paneer cheese is very light and soft with a texture like silken tofu but the flavor is of a mild cheese The cheese serves as a perfect counterpoint to the spicy spinach Going against tradition I sometimes add a small amount of cooked brown rice but I prefer the dish undiluted And I found the cheese chunks plentifulThe ingredients  spinach water tomatoes paneer cheese onions sunflower oil salt garlic cornstarch chilies cumin are startling in their simplicity Where is the long list of chemicals Grabbing a convenience meal often means sacrificing both flavor and health  this gluten free Kosher dish sacrifices nothing I will buy this dish as long as Tasty Bite continues to produce it
-1,As a consumer it is my right to know what ingredients are in the products I buy I find it very DECEPTIVE that Campbells products do NOT LIST upfront WHAT THE INGREDIENTS ARE IN EACH OF THEIR PRODUCTS So you have to go online elsewhere and lo and behold SUGAR IS IN THE FIRST INGREDIENTS Consumers beware that sugar is the NUMBER ONE ADDITIVE used by Campbells and it is the NUMBER ONE ADDICTIVE substance that people suffer from  Read labels Campbells ought to know better to be upfront and stop loading up the consumers with sugar instead of REAL TOMATO pure vegetable ingredients And in case anyone wants to be informed there are many DECEPTIVE LABELS MANUFACTURERS USE TO call sugar AND THEY ARE ALL THE SAME CHEMICALLY SUCH AS DEXTROSE MALTODEXTRIN SUCROSE SUCRALOSE CORN SYRUP ORGANIC sugar I love this one so it is made without fertilizers NOTHING IS HEALTHY ABOUT SUGAR
1,This is a much better Coffee than the French Market brand sole in our local grocery stores as chicory Coffee  It tastes like a higher quality Coffee and its just so much better once you try this brand of Louisiana coffee youll never touch French Market again This is a mellow smooth yet strong Coffee with a pleasant after taste that you will enjoy how it lingers after youre finished with your last cup for the morning French Market its only competitor is bitter too strong the last cup in the pot is almost undrinkable and you need to wash your mouth out with something with something that will get the bitterness out of your mouth its so bad Ive on occasion used peppermint tea after one or two cups of French MarketNot with Cafeacute Du Monde I can sit and drink an entire pot of this delicious Coffee and I love the lingering aftertaste Weather with a typical breakfast Donuts Cereal or just plain toast this Coffee compliments the flavor of everything you eat Just having it alone is like a treatIf you have been drinking French Market please try this brand and find out what you have been missing
1,We eat so many of these McCormick Salad Toppins that it is much easier more convenient and less expensive for us to purchase them online  They are excellent to snack on top salads with and put on baked or mashed potatoes  YUM
1,hard candy with a smooth creamy milk taste i love having these on hand for when you want something sweet
-1,Hydrolized proteins are MSG If you have MSG sensitivities or related migraines dont buy this This product claims to be free of MSG but it really just hides it under a different name
1,I liked these crackers but they tasted a bit too toasty for me Good sweetness with a hint of salty Dont know if Id buy them again just ok for me
1,Ive loved Slim Jims since I was a kid in the 70s and these are just the way I remember them  a little greasy chewy a little spicy  This box of 100 contains the small sized sticks  about 4 inches long individually wrapped and stored in a dispenser box  They dont have to be refrigerated which makes them easy to tuck into a purse or lunch boxThese arent the spicy flavor  I think you have to order the jalapeno or tabasco flavor to get those  But these are slightly spicy chewy and delicious  Nobody eats Slim Jims because theyre health food  they contain preservatives and low grade meats  But for a quick snack or if you just want something spicy these are the same yummy snacks youll remember from your childhood  They are also high protein and zero carbs which is good for those who are dietingIve ordered this box three times and have been happy with it every time  Free shipping with Amazons Supersaver Shipping makes it a good deal  And if you sign up for automatic delivery no obligation to keep getting it past the first shipment you will save an additional 15 making each stick about 20 cents apiece
-1,Tastes like spicy cardboard Really overrated product I will not buy this again period I dont recommend it
1,EASY TO MAKE AND THE TASTE IS JUST GREAT LOVE IT
1,I like all three flavors The mocha seems the sweetest I enjoy them for the healthy ingredients fiber and protein content I keep coming back to these and give them as gifts
-1,liked the individual wrappingthe taste too much preservative or chemical taste will not repurchase you will have to try for yourself to see if you dont mind the extra taste
1,I think its the best mix on the market and Amazon keeps you in a good supply with fast delivery on the Subscribe and Save Plan  Im trying to lose weight and a half cup is only 120 delicious calories  Great filling snack I think  Ive tried other snack mixes and find this to be the best  I know the have several different flavors but I find the traditional the best
1,Love my Keurig machine and I havent found a coffee I dont like  Actually I do not like flavored coffees but the regular ones are great I also use them over ice
1,My Mom is a big cashew fan and she really enjoyed these  You can always count on Planters
1,I finally conceded that my children prefer Kraft amac and cheese to any kind of home made I usually pick the whole grain variety but this is just as good and with a different added nutritional hit
1,I had purchased a few bottles of different Tabasco brand sauces at the supermarket and when I got home I noticed they were all expired or near expiration  This is a large supermarket in a busy area  So I decided to see what Amazon had to offer and I was delighted to see that I could actually order from McIlhenny directly  Click on the New link next to the number of other sellers  You will find a seller called Tabasco Brand Products  I ordered a total of 5 different sauces  When they arrived the oldest one was bottled a month prior  They do taste better when theyre this fresh
1,Essn is an excellent indulgence Not for drinking like a soda or every day Its more like a wonderful rewardThese are on the sweet side but also good solid lemon flavor They are not as sharp as San Pelligrinos Limonata But they nowhere near as sweet as Sierra Mist or Mountain DewI really love this product
-1,I too like other reviewers was surprised at the quality and texture of these cookies for a Pamelas Product I am an avid consumer of Pamelas gluten free products but this one I will be feeding to the birds First of all they are extremely rubbery When other reviewers comment that they are chewy they are chewy times 10 And they have a strange taste Its like a pseudopeanut butter flavor Probably because they are also dairy free I would not pay the 360 per box for a measly 12 cookies again
-1,The pecans all tasted sour  Yuck  These sour gross pecans ruined a HUGE batch of waffles I was making for a breakfast party  So embarrassing  Ill stick to the oldfashioned way  going home to my parents and picking up the pecans that fall off their tree
-1,I used to love it because it tasted great and it was reasonably priced Now the price is astronomical and the taste is not as chokolaty and too sweetI do not understand why it is so expensive now and why it is so sugary
1,One of the many flavorful coffees from Green Mountain  Highly recommend it to flavored coffee lovers using a Keurig
1,Since my diagnosis of celiac disease my family and I have tried several gluten free cake mixes all of them ranging from yuck and at least its cake to mildly disappointing  Pamelas cake is the best no question  Not only is it free of dairy and soy along with wheat I cannot digest legumes and many gluten free products seem to rely on bean flour but it makes TWO layers of cake  Compare that to Betty Crocker who bless her heart tried to introduce a gluten free cake mix only to have it make one measly layerWith one bag of Pamelas cake mix you can make a two layer birthday cake for your favorite person with celiac  This cake is so moist and yes the texture does change a bit over sitting but we like our cakes denser not so fluffy they flop around on our forks  Usually Im more a fan of the frosting than the cake but this is a cake you could serve without frostingAlso its easy to make My husband and kids made this without any practice and they are not experienced gluten free bakers Its easy as pie Or cake  Well be trying the vanilla variety very soonThanks Pamela
-1,If you like bland and pointless you will love this product It is not that it is bad but I do not know what I could have been thinking when I ordered it You can I guess spice this up to give it more flavor or add vegetables and meat to make a different product But frankly why bother You can make your own dish better with fresh rice spices beans and meat and vegetables if you want them
1,This is really good  I have stopped buying any processed foods and only buy organic or stuff that does not have any GMOs or bad additives This fills the bill  Sometimes I just like to have something that I can just make real quick and this is really quick to make  I can find the same thing at local store but it is more money and I have to go get itthis comes to me  I would recommend this to anyone
1,This is my favorite almond flour  tried another brand just to compare  will def stick with this one  Highly recommend
1,Years ago I tried stevia and didnt like it I thought it was bitter not sweet Now because of my daughters coaxing I have tried it again I have been educated to not use too much stevia because it will become bitter Used sparingly these drops will add a certain level of sweetness but not quite to the level Id usually want So these drops can be helpful but you may want to use them in addition to sugar or honey
-1,Typical of the US food industry they have to pack the product full of salt  By the time you you get the saltiness diluted out all the flavor is diluted out
1,It is a flavorful snack that provides enough flavor but isnt too salty nor that boring of a snack Its a pretty good alternative to potato chips or any other snack product
1,Now I feel like I am linked to the military for sure with these wonderful eggs  I use them to cook with I make omlets with them and usually I just scramble them  They are really special to me because when my son came home at Christmas 2012  for the first time in 14 years and I didnt even know if he was still alive I made him cheese egg omelets with these very eggs every morning  He LOVED them too  Thank you
1,Unbelievably good  we dont even miss the salt  Great cheesy flavor much like the national brand but so much less sodium
-1,Ive tried several of these Annie Chun noodle dishes and soups with noodles I dont find any of them very good as compared with real Asian food Some arent too bad when doctored with some soy sauce hot sauce or other sauce And some arent too bad for ease of preparationThis one isnt easily doctored nor is it that fastsimple to make Therefore I dont see any reason to keep in the pantry If I dont feel like spending 2030 minutes to make my own Asian food from scratch Ill stick with bettereasier readymade products to keep on hand
1,Someone sitting next to me at a tacqueria doused their taco with this stuff just like regular piquante took a bite and then paid the price for the next twenty minutes  Learning from his misfortune I took a few tinefulls on the tip of a fork on my taco    not even a full drop as recommended  Just the perfect amount  Two hours later I still feel a nice lingering heatAs for flavor I think serranos have a better flavor but this wasnt bad  I definitely would put a very very small on any food where I wanted that perfect amount of burnYou also may notice that only people from Texas and California have written reviews  This sauce really is for people who grew up eating Mexican and Southwestern food  I dont know if a New Yorker or someone from the Mid West would enjoy this stuff
1,The tea is pretty delicious and not bitter but I could not detect notes of Jasmine However this is still a great tea for bedtime as it is decaf I love the tea and would probably buy it  The price is still great especially with subscribe and save three stars
-1,This product claims it is Simply Salted though a read of ingredients I soon discover it has soybean oil
1,After being diagnosed with celiac disease I was desperate to find GF pasta As previous reviewers have stated with some extra shredded cheese added this tastes just like Kraft Mac and CheeseDowngraded a star because I have found better creamier mac an cheese from another manufacturer
-1,I wanted to avoid using food coloring due to it containing the ingredient red 40 So I used this powder for my red velvet cake The color of the red velvet cake was light brown this powder does not work for red velvet cakes
1,When I ordered these I was worried that they may not be fresh but I was surprised They were really fresh the smell is great too I can actually still smell it even though I sealed them back up The seller is JR Mushrooms  Specialties shipped from Amazon Warehouse with 2day prime shipping The beans didnt seem hot upon arrival either most likely because of the storms weve been getting in the area keeping it coolerI must also say my hands are smooth from handling all the beans from the oilsI used some of these to make vanilla extract I was able to make six cups before I ran out of vodka I was sad I didnt buy more vodka I will be buying a gallon of vodka soon so I can make more
-1,I tried so many different ways to pop this like I had seen on 34Bazar foods34 and I am not having a lot of luck I have found a tablespoon of coconut oil in a microwave popper to be the best so far but I still have a poor popping ratio of only about 50 I love the sweet nutty flavor and crunchy texture but with such a large  of unpopped berries it is not really cost effective I may give it a try again this summer as I purchased some seed to plant and will harvest my own
-1,I tried really hard to like the product it comes in a case of 12 after all but I just could not take the taste It looks like regular chili has some fat like regular chili has a texture like regular chili and it almost tastes good if you can get past the saltThis is the second and last of this brand and type of veggie product I will try They rely too much on salt to compensate for the perceived lack of flavor from real meat A much better IMHO veggie chili can be made with some diced onions tomatoes green bell peppers a hot chile of your choice garlic oregano chili powder a little masa tomato paste and one or more types of beans like pintos kidneys mayo coba etc Just a pinch of salt and your done or add your own meat or substitute if you have toI hope there are some vegetarians at the food bankEdit Ill add that many canned foods tend to be a little salty to me so we dont eat too many of them I will say that compared to other canned chilis I have tried vegetarian or not this compared favorably But I cant take salt out of a prepared food whereas others can always add salt This was the deal breaker for me as it is with other prepared canned chilis
1,This sampler variety has several teas geared towards sick people ranging from a cold to a sore throat to a stuffy noseI firmly beleive the teas also Good Earth tea for colds help alleviate some of the symptoms So I give both 5 stars for the benefitsI just wish that they tasted better
1,This tea is really comforting Its a lot of cinnamon and some apple in the background I think it can get extremely spicy if you arent careful when steeping it though I microwave a huge 810 oz mug filled with water then steep for 5 minutes It definitely doesnt need any added sugar Its sweet by itself almost too sweet if you let it steep for too long I
-1,I wish I had time to grow chives and the green thumb but since I do not I purchased McCormicks freeze dried chives I used them in 3 dinners this week and they dont have much aroma or flavor All they seem to do is add a little color I would stick with the fresh chives from the grocery since these dont seem to translate as well as McCormicks rosemary parsley or basil which I have tried and love
1,Good nuts and a good price
-1,I like Kashi products in general but this bar is too sweet nor was there any crunchy bits of anything It is a chewy bar but does not give your jaws the same workout their turtle bar does which was a relief I think Ill stick the their cereals and granola bars As for protein bars I much prefer Balance bars
1,I used to be able to buy this in the grocery store but I havent seen it in ages so I was tickled to find it at Amazon  The case of 24 packets that I received had a Use By date some two years away so I have plenty of time to enjoy my custardThere are two ways I like to make it 1 Add an egg yolk to the milkmix and bring to boil  Pour into a baked pastry dish  After it cools top with Rediwhip cream and shredded coconut then slice for a custard cream pie 2 Slice bananas into a serving bowl and cover with the boiled custard mix  Sprinkle with nutmeg and place in fridge to coolOverall rating Yummy
1,I am mostly glutenfree because I feel better when I avoid gluten One of my favorite foods is mac and cheese When I discovered Annies Creamy Deluxe Rice Pasta Dinner I tried it and loved it Its good just the way it is but sometimes I add ham and make a really rich creamy dinner by adding in cream cheese butter grated sharp cheddar and halfandhalf Yum
1,Treating gallstones and no longer drink soda or coffee or regular tea I buy this by the case drink it room temp all during the day Probably drink more of this than water My integrative dietitian likes this product as well No surgery for this customerlol
1,For years Spice Islands Lemon Pepper was my goto favorite until I tried this one I really like the fact that I can taste the lemon pieces more which I particularly like on veggies I use this spice often
-1,this stuff is a poor example of an authentic 5spice powder which I paid 15 for 4oz locally despite the fact that other Dynasty products are useful such as their Satay sauce  I live walking distance to Flushing Queens and have a good idea what its supposed to taste like from authentic Asian cooking sold nearby If you want to go cheap off Amazon you are better off withFrontier Five Spice Powder 192Ounce Bottle  BTW star anise or aniseed is already a licorice flavor so to add even more licorice to this bottle was foolish
1,After careful consideration and reading all the helpful reviews that made my mouth water I tried this product  I was not disappointed in the least  It makes the perfect comfort food  In fact I had a rather stressful day and made some and it made me feel quite good  I am not sure what is in the packet of sauce mix but it is wonderful when combined with tomato paste and water  It makes your taste buds singIf you are on the fence about this one try it You will love it  My gratitude goes out to everyone of you that have done a review Oh and to Amazon too
1,This is a great tasting creamy pasta dish To cut the salt use less of the seasoning packet save rest to flavor gravy or soup Use 1 Tlbs each unsalted butter  oil for creamy Using oil alone isnt great in this pasta  if you do select a high quality EVOO Extra Virgin olive oil instead of other bland oils Freeze the extra boxes and if you do find bugs theyre dead and can easily be picked out then you rinse the pasta and proceed Add a can of chicken for a main dish that feeds two adults Our case arrived with no problems and no bugs Great dish for the elderly also since pasta is small and creamy easy to eat Try it
1,Its great for a quick meal and smells good I wouldthrow in some veggies to spruce it upRead the package for other ideas to add to itI look at Hamburger Helper as a Start up andadd things to it
-1,When you make this kimchi according to the instructions you essentially are letting the cabbage soak overnight in brine then draining it and mixing in a packet of ground spices before sticking it immediately into the refrigerator to let the flavors marry This is NOT the same thing as fermenting a batch of kimchi for days at room temperature so that those wonderful fermentation bubbles build up and render the special tang on the tongue that I realized after making this is critical to good kimchiI also found the flavor strange too sweet and also a little off in a way I cannot describe I didnt weigh my cabbage but I selected a standardsized Napa head so it had to be in the ballpark of four pounds But the flavor of the packet overwhelmed the cabbage completely I wound up rinsing off as much as I could then stuffing the cabbage back into a mason jar and putting it under airlock on the counter to see if I can salvage the batch The verdict is still outIm not a kimchi purist or connoisseur but I know enough to know this isnt what I like Im going back to Sandor Katz technique fromWild Fermentation The Flavor Nutrition and Craft of LiveCulture Foodsand see if I cant get closer to something I cant stop eating Maybe I can work some of this product into the recipe somewhere along the way and itll be magic and I do hope this is the case because Ive got 11 packets left
1,This stuff is wonderful  As soon as I start getting any kind of tickle in my throat or sniffle  I start drinking  It clears it up within a day or two  Highly recommend  Tastes nice as well
-1,Do not buy this product The ingredients are different from those listed on the websiteOnly purchase if you like MSG corn syrup and natural flavorThis is a list of the actual ingredientsPeanutsSea SaltSugarCornstarchMonosodium glutamate MSGGelatinTorula yeastCorn syrup solidsPaprikaOnion and garlic powdersSpicesNatural flavor
-1,For well over a year I have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food  Before I started doing this I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches  Even though I have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period El Yucateco has set itself apart from the others as being one that I do not care for  It is overpoweringly hotwith a searing heatand has an odd unenjoyable flavor  Although not a terrible hot sauceI consumed the entire bottleEl Yucateco is a hot sauce that I am glad that I tried but it just is not my thing
1,I love Dark Roast and this is a good brand  Some coffees are not strong enough but this is great  Also the price is great and it was delivered within 2 days  I will keep buying from vendor
-1,Yeah this isnt a real good energy drink at allA bit sour and it leaves you with an aftertaste that you cant quite figure outToo much sugar besidesTrying to give away the rest of my 24pack but no takers as of yet
1,Does the job it is intended to do for me Doctor prescribe this for my digestive system and I use it religiously
1,I love these because there is not too much sugar and its gluten free  Plus my kids adore these  My son doesnt like the peanut butter flavored ones but he eats one of these every day and he is a picky eater  Would buy again
1,Great pack of sugar cubes Pretty self explanatory what it is Makes a great treat Also great for giving to horses they love them
-1,Shaped like Mushroom Caps and similar consistencyLoma Linda Tender Bits 19Ounce Cans Pack of 12I paid 7045  for 12 of these I also bought several of the other products from this brandThey are Heavy ALL were shipped in On large boxSEVERAL cans have HUGE dents in them
-1,These are nothing like the ones in the bigger tubs  These nuts are smaller taste greasy and are very salty  I dont mind salt at all but these were way too salty
1,My favorite brand of salt and pepper pistachios  Other brands dont have enough pepper so all you taste is salt
-1,I actually love Pirates Booty snacks so I was over eager and purchased 2 huge cases of these  Yikes these are going to hard to get rid of  A previous reviewer states that they are like fish food and I second that notion  I would definitely recommend steering clear of these and choosing one of the much better flavors like cheese  I dont know exactly how to describe these but imagine a stale sock soaked in broccoli juice and youre on the right track  My typically nondiscriminating 14 month old turns his nose up at these  These taste like something super healthy and though they arent bad for you they are not healthy enough to warrant choking them down  They are worth a try as a toddler snack but Id order cautiously or you will have lots of fish food tasting snacks that you will be trying to give away to any unsuspecting victim that will take them off of your hands
1,I have ordered Premium Bourbon Madagascar Vanilla Beans before and they were Big Plump and Fresh The last ones Ive got 16 in a Bag are shorter thinner dryer and not as Plump as the ones I purchased before They are still good but the ones before were the Best I used the 16 Vanilla Beans that comes in the bag with Vodka 750 ML Bottle to make Vanilla Extract and also used them for Baking Desserts Even with the drop in Quality Premium Bourbon Madagascar Vanilla Beans are a bargain over the Supermarket Prices Thank You DD
1,This formula works great  It is a bit cheaper here on Amazon than at my local Walmart  It has reduced my daughters spit up greatly  You will need a square or slit type nipple as this formula is a bit thicker than others  Best to use warm water to mix also
1,This is used in addition to my other salts of choice sea and Kosher  I delivers a type of vanilla flavor especially when used in things like pancakes waffles and some deserts that call for a touch of salt
1,I tried to find this spice and was unsuccessful It is a great spice that I use not only in making Asian recipes but in many other dishes as well I find it to be very versatile and an asset to my spice cupboard
-1,We eat a lot of popcorn I mean a lot We buy it in 50 bags  just the two of us the wife an I I like flavors on my popcorn and use garlic butter Parmesan cheese and other flavors This cheese powder seemed like just the thing for a great flavoring on my popcorn But I was wrong I tried it once The bag is still clipped shut in the cupboard The texture was gritty and more stuck to the bowl than the popcorn The color is more intense than the flavor I didnt find it to be that cheese flavored popcorn I imaginedI told my wife to use it up in other dishes that could use a bit more cheese but I dont think she is too thrilled to try it again Live and learn
-1,I found this oddly fibrous and inedible It was almost like there was paper or rubber in my mouth as I chewed on this At first I thought it was just that stick so I opened another one and it was exactly the same
-1,these undersized and overpriced packets of miso soup has additives like dry fish powder and i did not notice the small print of ingredients before buying and accepting shipment i have other products ordered through amazon that are great and repeatedly shipped to my door but this product is inferior and i wish i could get a refund on unused and still sealed portion
-1,Its hot stuff like horseradish is Throw in some green coloring and VIOLA you have 34wasabi34 It is obvious this is NOT Wasabi root the original Japanese sushi and sashimi spice Says so right on the pack Worse is the great price at 199 until you notice the shipping at 525 making the total ACTUAL price 724 Pick it up at your local grocery store in the Asian section for 179 Wish Amazon would make vendors clarify BOTH cost UP FRONT instead of the old bait and switch No sale
1,I spent mny hours trying to match the halves up to make wholes which would have made this an exceptional value but I ended up eating my homework It was quite yummy
1,These bars taste wonderful and have 20 grams of protein The texture is soft and chewy very fudge like Excellent flavor and taste My teenage boys have already eaten half the box and I have to order more
1,well people complained about the candies but I actually find them very delicious I dont really think they are made like back in the 60s or I hope they are not lol I tried them all and they seem fresh so I am giving them 5 stars plus the box is pretty neat
-1,I love beef  I love honey  I love barbecue sauce  I found this flavor so revolting I could not even gag one bite downSomething has gone drastically wrong here
-1,These have a great mild flavor but Ive recently read celestial seasonings is using a higher than acceptable amount of pesticides in their tea leaves
-1,This review is based on a single bar provided by the Amazon Vine programI eat a lot of bars from protein bars to snack bars  This bar is small but packs 230 calories 20 grams of protein no sugar and 25 grams of carbs  The chocolate covering had good flavor and consistency  It wasnt too waxy or melty  The interior is a single mass of dry filling  It had a vague chocolately espresso taste but wasnt good  It was also very dryIf you need gluten free it may be an ok option but Ill be looking elsewhere
1,I use wheat gluten in my homemade breads and wanted to make sure I had a nice stock supply of it for long term storage  These cans stay good for MANY years so if you use it then just replenish and if not it will still be good if times if disaster strike  I recommend having some on hand if you are a baker
1,The best cereal I found so far that is organic gluten free and tastes good and one I can get at a discounted price through subscribe and save My son eats this almost every day and doesnt get tired of it I just add fruit or raisins for variety
-1,I bought this on the recommendation of a friend who LOVES this tea I dont find the vanilla taste strong enough nor is the hazelnut flavoring strong Its not distinctively either taste and I dont care for the blend even though I love both those flavors
1,I have been buying these from Amazon forever  Very tasty and the sweetness lasts a long time  Its also good after a meal as it helps freshen your breath and get the food out of your teeth  But be very careful around your dogs as the sweetener in these is poisonous to dogs and perhaps other animals
1,Great taste  i actually cute amount in half because this is a strong vanilla taste Great product Would buy again
-1,Drastic change to this product from what is pictured I was a huge fan of the Genisoy Soy Crisps Deep Sea Salted the old formula but if you order these now they will arrive to you marked as New look and improved taste Not sure who determined that the taste is improved but in my opinion these are awfulThe old crisps were nice and puffy very light tasting and a great salt flavor The new crisps looks like they kept them in the oven for an hour too long They are paper thin now very crunchy burnt colored burnt tasting and I think they left the salt off  And when you open a bag dont be surprised to find mostly broken pieces inside instead of whole crisps Ive opened two bags so far and 50 of them are broken into tiny pieces They are so thin and fragile nowJust beware before you buy a case of these that they have changed very much Id suggest finding a bag in a grocery store first and trying them out before investing in an entire case of a very changed productA big thumbs down to Genisoy on this one
1,So I know there is a warning that you should not drink these teas if you are pregnant or breastfeeding but I want to remind you that just about every product out there has that warning on it for legal reasons Even their Mothers Milk tea has that warning and it is made specifically to help women increase their breast milk supply while breastfeeding With that saidI am breastfeeding and have been for a long time Before I found these teas I would suffer through a sore throat stuffy nose cold etc with out taking medication because I didnt want my babytoddler to get any through my breast milk Herbal remedies are much gentler on your body so I feel very comfortable knowing that these herbs will be passed to my child instead of a strong chemical remedy like DayQuil I make my teas very strong and add some local raw honey for even more health benefits and it makes the teas taste even better I do enjoy the taste of the teas much more than I thought I would since they are after all medical remedies The teas are not miracle cures but they really do help and you dont get a doped up feeling like you do from a lot of the OTC meds out there Im not sure I have a favorite I find they are all really nice to have on hand when you need them I also enjoy just drinking them mainly the Cold Care and Echinacea as a nice cup of tea on a cold dayBuy one box and see what you think I dont think youll be disappointedEDITI just wanted to add that while in general herbs are pretty safe when breastfeeding you do not want to take them as supplements or eatdrink extremely large amounts of them with out first making sure they are safe You would probably have to drink an entire box of this stuff in one day for it to really cause any problems with breastfeeding so if you drink the typical 16 cups using 1 tea bag per cup 6 cups steeped with 2 tea bags each might be a little much you should be fineEDITJust found out from my midwife that although these teas are safe to drink while breastfeeding they are not safe to drink while pregnant except for the Echinacea which is safe to drink while pregnant Bummer I guess my 6 boxes will be sitting in the pantry for the next 9 months
-1,I expected more to be honest These taste EXACTLY like that cheap snack that comes in a box called Nutty Bars I always hated those because they were so cheap tasting Also really Natural AND Artificial flavors Its just chocolate and peanut butter you really need to go artificial with such basic flavors Okay
1,I love this stuff iced I put it in bottles with some Splenda and take it to work Very refreshing
-1,I could certainly go on for more than 20 words about how much I hated this coffee  Fortunately I didnt pay for it because it came with my machine as a sampler  Yuck  It doesnt taste like good coffee and it doesnt taste like French Vanilla  Point blank I couldnt even finish the cup and had to pour it down the drain  The aftertaste is even worse  I dont understand how anyone could give this a positive review but I guess its all a matter of individual preference
1,WHAT CAN BE SAID ABOUT MY OLD TIME TREAT OF MY LIFEI RECALL FEELING HORRIBLE WHEN I WAS A KID AND FINISHED ONE PACKAGEAS AN ADULT I NOW BUY A CASE AND FEEL SPOILED ROTTEN THEY ARE SO DELECTABLETHIS IS WHAT YOU GET WHEN YOU BECOME AN ADULTMORE THAN ONE PACKAGEISNT LIFE GREAT
1,I stumbled onto this product years ago I cant buy it here locally anymore at the grocery It is delicious Dont let the name fool you it is not firey hot but just right with a hint of sweetness Take a chance and buy a bottle you will not be dissapointed
-1,The SMART pop doesnt have enough flavoring   I do not like it sam I am
1,my niece teaches underprivileged kids in florida  she had a science lesson and i sent her 3 boxes of this stuff  most of the kids would never in their lives have had a chance to taste this stuff  so for the price it was a good deal to share something that these kids would never have had
1,Ive had a lot of different kinds of cococnut water and this is by far the most palatable flavor for me It is not too sweet or sugary tasting like some brands This has a nice chocolate flavor that goes perfect with the coconut Theres also no aftertaste it goes down clean Excellent beverage for rehydrating especially when you let it get real cold This is better for you than drinking gatorade I like to put mine in the freezer before I exercise and take it out just before it starts to freeze or right after i finish exercising Very refreshing and gets rid of my sweet tooth
-1,I was only able to use one of a dozen cans  they had to be disposed of as they were rusted dented and dirty After disinfencting the only undamaged can i found this product to be delicious  it is a shame i wont attempt to reorder This is the 3rd Loma Linda product that has arrived in such horrible  unsanitary and unusable condition
-1,I grew up eating the puffed rice in the big bags by MaltOMeal and I LOVE that stuff Thought these would be similar but it wasnt the case I ended up donating them to a thrift store that offers free mealsso at least it went to a good cause 0  I couldnteven dress them up with a little white sugar
-1,Im really curious as to what blended black tea means It doesnt say it on the ingredients list but it smells and tastes just like menthol camphor and eucalyptus oil with a nice blend of cinnamon which it does list In removing it from the wrapper it had such a strong aroma of Vicks Vapor Rub that it gave me second thoughts as to whether it was safe to drink However I did want to try it so here I am alive and still kicking The only positive thing I can say is that it has a nice cinnamon flavor that pleasantly lingers in my mouth and the packaging is easy on the eyes Not sure what the manufacturers were thinking though in putting this product out in the public arena as a beverage The ingredients are blended black tea ginger root cinnamon cinnamon oil clove oil allspice nutemeg clove and cardamon oil Because of the unknown element I wouldnt be surprised if they started marketing it as a familiar cold remedy Todd Wilburyou missed one
-1,A couple years ago I drank this every day It was rich with cardomom flavor When I recently reordered I found that like everything else in this sorry world the quality of the tea had deteriorated drastically It is bland and flat compared with the spicey richness of flavor in the past I wrote to complain they replied they used the same recipe Its the ingredients and the process that countnot the recipe  I may have to make it myselfJanuary 2014I bought a couple of boxes in hopes they had raised their standards No such luck Crummy crummy crummy I wonder how these people can live with themselves knowing theyre selling inferior products
1,This is a very good tea for your health and helps you sleep relax and other good things It also tastes great so I know you will like it too

1,I received this package yesterday in a very sturdy box and last night I decided to try them and they are sooooooooooooo delicious  The cheese doesnt get on your fingers or hand like the orange balls and they are fresh The only problem is that you cant stop eating them  They just melt in your mouth and they are crunchie  You can be sure that when I am almost done with them I will order them again  I would give these twenty stars if I could plus working as a Court Stenographer in court I am aware of identity theft and I know when I order something from Amazon my identity and my card is safe
-1,Since this was for a child since the child didnt like itit kind of goes without saying that I didnt like it either  Rather than taking to this formula the reaction was more of a 34get this away from me as soon as possible34 so we wont be buying it anymore  Which is kind of a good thing as I was hesitant to even try this as soy is quite the versatile food  but with a large array of negative 34side effects34 regardless of how its preparedAll in all I wouldnt recommend thisnor would the child that wouldnt drink it
1,This product is of excellent quality since it is made from brown rice I gave it only 4 stars because of the price which is 566 a pound Walmart sells Natto rice pasta at 348 a pound It is easier to work with because it comes in spaghettilike strands Annie Chuns seems to be one strand wrapped over and over which is a little more difficult to handle Both products make great pad Thai noodles with peanut sauce Just whisk together one tablespoon of creamy peanut butter per 8 ounces 2 tablespoons of soy sauce and some chili pepper to taste Toss with the cooked noodles and top with green onionspeanuts and a little lime or lemon juice Delicious
-1,I expected more cocoa but its rather like more a spice tea but not as delicious as chai if you want spicy just go for chai definitely this is not cocoa tea at all i do not see a point to buy this tea again
-1,This tea just isnt for meI thought it was a little gross It didnt seem to taste like chocolate OR hazelnutsI dont really think it had much taste at all really  Pretty disappointing I didnt add any sugar to it so perhaps the flavor would change a little with some sweetness
1,This is definitely different even though the packaging looks similar to the other honey I have boughtYS Eco Bee Farms Raw Honey  22 oz  This honey is a whole food and avoids all of the processes that are involved with making that other honey that is available on the grocers shelvesI love the raw spun kind of honey  The thickness and the taste of flowers you can get an idea of what types of flowers the bees visited give this particular brand a light floral tasteMy bottle had a crystallized layer at the top that was almost waxy  This added to the flavor and texture and was not a problem  As others have mentioned this can be softened by placing the bottle in hot water  I find that this honey is great on my Udis GF bread as toastUdis Gluten Free Whole Grain Bread 1 Case  A spoonful of the honey is great for the throat and just feels goodLove it
-1,ThinkThin Chocolate Fudge Gluten Free bars may very well be the worse bar that I have ever tasted Think of everything that the words chocolate fudge create in your mind This is none of those It has a very strange texture as well Total pass
1,Yeah this dye is tasteless as advertised  I know there are already a million 5 star reviews but I thought I would join the chorus anyways The dyes here are really vibrant and most importantly tasteless This allows you to make really beautiful fondant cakes  I literally put like 1 drop of this dye gel in about a 4 ball of fondant and it came out the shade I wanted The colors are pretty much full spectrum of the rainbow plus black You can mix and match if you want to get more colors I found it very easy to use There are instructions on the box I paired this with purchased fondant and made a very lovely orange red and black Halloween themed cake I cant wait to use these again For the price of less than 11 I feel like I got a good deal
-1,I did not like the taste of this at all  The flavor was a bit spicy and was not what I expected from Hamburger Helper
-1,always been a huge campbells soup fan  have been eating it for years sorry but this is the worse soup i have ever tastedi could not even finish one can i tried different things to enhance the flavor but nothing helped  its just unreal surelycampbells did not sample this soup before they put it out for saleif i could i would give it less than 1 starlola
-1,Amazon is treating all of McCormick organic Gourmet Collection spices as a single item review This is why one can see so many different reviews about different spices in one place since a different spice can be selected by scrolling down the flavor option Different spices taste differently originated differently and are different genetically McCormick is an excellent brand Amazon is the one that needs to get it together Reviewing so many food items as though presented as a single product is misleading practice by Amazon
-1,These are OK  Not the best kind of protein soy is inadequate to whey or other types and not a whole bunch of it  They taste good but I have found better tasting bars for around 200 calories  Not the highest quality ingredients either  For this type of bar meal replacement I would recommend a Clif bar  It tastes better has higher quality ingredients and leaves you feeling much fuller for a much longer period of time
-1,I was expecting this to taste as good as some of the other coconut waters and what an unpleasant surprise  I cannot even finish one bottle  UGH
-1,I am a regular consumer of Slim Jim products  at least twice a week I buy one from the counter at the cafe in my office building But these Slim Jims from Amazon didnt taste right  I dont know if it was a combination of the exceedingly hot weather and these Slim Jims traveling some distance on the back of a hot truck to be delivered to me but I eagerly tore open the package took one bite couldnt even swallow it and ended up throwing the entire Slim Jim in the trash after I tried a second bite just to make sure my mind wasnt playing tricks on me It tasted horrible So Im not sure whats up because like I said these are products I eat regularly  Im not some health food nut vegan who just ordered a product so I could condemn it and then lecture everyone else about the evils of eating meat I like meat and I like Slim Jims But I didnt like the taste of these
-1,It tastes absolutely the same as any other store macandcheese  The totally natural cheese is a fineastalcumpowder substance in a foil packet  Save some money and buy the store brand for 69 cents on sale at Ralphs Market
-1,The product itself was just fairBut the worst part of this order the condition that it came in  All six bags were terribly broken up  Each bag had very little chex pieces left in them because of poor shipping  I purchased another item along with this one and who ever packaged this put a box in the middle of a shipping box and put the chex mix on the sides as if they were packaging cushions  Who does Amazon have working in their shipping department  Obviously not a lot of common sense  I will not buy this product again or any other fragile items
1,Very nice selection  All teas are aromatic and string strentgh makes great tea and learned which to buy in bulk
-1,I bought this recently not paying attention to brand  When I got it home I realized it was Stash and thought oh no here comes the weak teaIndeed as with other of their teas it is weak  I used up almost the entire box of tea bags to make a pitcher full of iced tea and it was still pretty weak in flavor  When Ive made hot tea with it I need two tea bagsThe flavor is okI love the tartness of hibiscus and the raspberrybut its really just too weak overall  Will not purchase again
1,Purchased these as a gift  I was told by the recipient an advent teadrinker that it tastes wonderful and the leaves blossom very big  Pleased w my purchase  Be warned that they are samples and are not big
1,Ive been enjoying this tea regularly for several years now  I love Rooibos tea to start with and the vanilla is subtle and not too sweet or fake tasting  If you arent familiar with Rooibos teas I describe them as smelling like caramel and twigs  Earthy slightly toasty and sweet enough to enjoy without adding anything  Ill continue to buy this as one of my favorite tea staples along with Celestial Seasonings Perfectly Pear 
-1,There was to much powdered cheese in each container  I tried to remove as much as I could but it still didnt taste good
1,The best Key Lime Juice if you cant get them fresh  I used it for pie and ice cream and the flavor was great  Too bad our stores here in VT do not carry it so I am forced to pay this primo price online
-1,This review is for the Chocolate Fudge flavor of the Think Thin Bars  In a word yuck  This bar may be all kinds of nutritious but you have to want to eat it for that to take any effectThe taste and texture was kind of like eating cocoa powder dusted Styrofoam  It was kind of chewy and soft all at the same time and the only flavor aside from a dry flat taste was the cocoa powder  And it was more like a milk chocolate for the cocoa powder as it had that kind of sour aftertaste  Needless to say I didnt enjoy itThe ingredients are decent  The following is the ingredients list copied from Think Thins websitePROTEIN BLEND WHEY PROTEIN ISOLATE SOY PROTEIN ISOLATE CALCIUM CASEINATE CASEIN GLYCERIN MALTITOL COATING MALTITOL COCOA BUTTER CHOCOLATE SODIUM CASEINATE MILK FAT SOY LECITHIN NATURAL FLAVORS SALT ALMONDS WATER CANOLA OIL CHOCOLATE ALKALIZED COCOA SOY LECITHIN NATURAL FLAVORS SEA SALTYou would think since it was real chocolate and cocoa butter that it would have been a bit better tasting but all I can think is that perhaps they used low grade chocolate  And I was really surprised to see almonds listed in there I didnt taste them at all  And using Maltitol for the sweetener I would have preferred stevia or even just a tiny bit of cane sugar yes I realize part of this products boast is having 0 grams of sugar but a tiny bit wouldnt hurt  Still for a protein bar this isnt a bad list in comparison to other brandsThis product is certified to be gluten free and it is sugar free unlike many bars out there  So it is unique in that aspect and good for those on special diets  Theres 240 calories per bar but this is meant to be a meal replacement or training snack not a regular snack  8 grams of fat and 1 gram of fiber are in it along with 20 grams of protein which is a lot  And while there is no sugar sugar alcohol is present as 12 grams of this barI wouldnt buy these again  At least not in this flavor  Perhaps some of the others are a little better tasting  But I couldnt even finish this bar I thought it tasted so bad and Im not normally one to waste food  But perhaps with different taste buds someone could enjoy this enough to reap its nutritional benefitsReview by M Reynard 2013
-1,I enjoy many types of tea the more flavorful the better I received this in a sampler that I purchased and did not find it to be very good It has a very oily taste to it I will finish off the tea bags that came in the box but would not purchase this type again
1,Now my wife and motherinlaw are addicted too  Great for cooking not just for smearing  Larger size is much more economical  Appreciate that
-1,think its add water and nuke nope you get 12 small boxes not half filled with pasta and a small pack of squishy cheddar boil 1012 the way you would with other pasta then the cheese oh and then you need milk for 30 some bucks get a real box of glutenfree pasta a chunk of cheddar and a quart of milk for maybe 14 of this ripoff its just standard ingredients not quick not in a container to nuke or heat divided up into 12 little boxes look down and read all the cooking directions and it does say add milk but not up front about the product
-1,I used to eat this stuff 10 20 years ago cant remember I do remember it being awesome and totally delicious and hard to stop eating which is why I stopped buying it I bought a box recently now that Im better at portion control and found much to my great sadness that it tastes totally different The texture is also different before it was crunchy and broke apart right away whereas now it sort of sticks together more and is a lot less crunchy I found it so much less good that Im not even eating it and am trying to slough it off onto my husband who is less picky about food in general
1,My son and I are converts No more of the snacks hot fires  potato clips etc  with artificial colors and flavors  They have been replaced  We love these I had no idea what they tasted like when I first ordered them  I just went by the other reviews  I am so glad I did  We cant find them locally here in New Mexico My son was addicted to Hot Fries but always admitted they made him feel terrible after he would eat them Now he does not feel terrible after he eats these  They have a little soft  crunch but not too much and they do not leave you with that icky taste in your mouth afterwards  These are all natural so I actually feel good eating them No guilt
-1,I didnt care for the smell at all my personal preference  It didnt smell like roses more like a strange fake flower scent  The lotion was good but I couldnt use it
-1,Taste like cough syrup Its kind of sugary but has a very plastic and unnatural taste and a slightly bittersweet aftertasteWait no its not exactly sweet Its just slightly bitter And leaves a very very strange chemicallike unnatural sensation on your tongue Yup taste like cough syrup
-1,I really wanted my kids to like this But unfortunately they dont it would not soak the milk so it stayed crunchy and its bigger and bulkier than Cheerios  which was the cereal I was trying to replace I still think its very good quality Organic and NonGMO I will offer it to my kids as a dry snack they might like it better or try to cook it in milk to make a sort of porridge out of it and maybe include it in my baking
-1,my daughter liked them but they were broken and some crushedand a little stalebut my daughter was satisfiedthank you very muchthe last just to get enough words
-1,This doesnt taste like any cream of broccoli soup Ive ever hadnot even the regular canned condensed version from Campbells  Very disappointing  I gave it to my local soup kitchen along with some other canned goods  I wouldnt have been able to eat it myself
-1,I tasted this product at a friends house I had to use a lot more of it than I do with pure stevia and I realized why when I examined the product label and researched information on the product on the NuNaturals website This product is mostly maltodextrin This is what is stated in the product information from NuNaturals Add NuStevia to sweeten your favorite food or beverage 14 tsp is as sweet as 1 tsp of sugar For recipes 4 tbs 14 cup is as sweet as 1 cup of sugarPure stevia powder is presumed to be 200 times as sweet as sugar Individual perceptions of sweetness may vary but I personally find the best brands of pure stevia to be about 40 times as sweet as sugar Given that the stevia powder used in this product is at best per the companys own admission only about 4 times as sweet as sugar that means that this product is only about onetenth steviaFor my own consumption I much prefer to purchase100 pure stevia powder Im not a fan of maltodextrin mixed with stevia and certainly not of natural flavors added to any food I consume which are for reasons unknown added to this product I explain what those ingredients are belowIngredients Maltodextrin stevia extract and natural flavors Free of soy MSG yeast gluten wheat milk synthetics artificial colors or flavors preservatives saccharin aspartame sucralose or artificial sweetenersMaltodextrin This is a food additive that is either without taste or slightly sweet It is commonly used in the processedfood industry as a thickener or filler to improve the texture and appearance in processed food As a relatively cheap ingredient it can also add more bulk to a given product thereby increasing profits for the company using it In the US most of the time it is derived from rice corn or potato starch Through a process called hydrolysis the starch is reduced to its basic amino acids Then an enzyme is used to break it down even further resulting in a powder that instantly dissolves in water Products such as jams and powdered substances which contain maltodextrin are required by law to say wheat in the the nutrition labeling if the maltodextrin is derived from wheatNatural Flavor The definition of natural flavor under the Code of Federal Regulations is The essential oil oleoresin essence or extractive protein hydrolysate distillate or any product of roasting heating or enzymolysis which contains the flavoring constituents derived from a spice fruit or fruit juice vegetable or vegetable juice edible yeast herb bark bud root leaf or similar plant material meat seafood poultry eggs dairy products or fermentation products thereof whose significant function in food is flavoring rather than nutritional 21CFR10122 That essentially means that natural flavor is derived from a real food but the process by which it is derived is unexplained and there is no way to know how safe or healthy a natural flavoring is
-1,The Chocolate Espresso flavor of the thinkThin bars is the only one I have tasted and I found it disappointing  There was no coffee flavor to the bar other than bitterness  Is that supposed to be the espresso flavor  I have tasted many other things with a better coffee flavor  The chocolate flavor is strong but more of a baking chocolate flavor not candy flavor  Of course since the bar contains zero sugar barely any fat and is gluten free it isnt going to have a rich flavor to it It contains 20 grams of protein but only 10 Calcium and 15 Iron for the RDA  It leaves a strong after taste that made me grab for a beverage to get rid of it  If you like a bitter chocolate flavor then you would like this bar  Personally I wont be eating another of this flavor
1,This product imparts a delicious flavor to beans omelets and gravy This is the way to get the flavor you want without drowning in fat calories Useful for every kitchen
-1,Im astounded how much praise Annie Chun keeps getting for her noodles When I see people practically orgasming at how wonderful they are this tells me they dont have much experience with this type of productDont get me wrong her noodles arent the worst thing Ive ever had except this one horrible exception but there are better tasting noodles for literally half of what her noodles cost For example Myojo Udon puts out these delectable packets seeMyojo Udon Japanese Style Noodles with Soup Base Chicken Flavor 722Ounce Bag Pack of 15 that can be had for about a dollar and they are way more flavorful than this particular bowl Dont buy them from Amazon though get them at your local Asian grocers or trusty online retailerOf course the Myojo Udon type noodles arent as easy to prepare as Annie Chun bowls you cant really nuke them in a microwave you have to boil them then add a flavor packet But in the end the taste is worth the extra hassle I would sooner take a one dollar pack of flavorful udon noodles that took 56 minutes to prepare on a stovetop over a watered down version that took 3 minutes in a microwave
1,I find the small 28 ounce ones to be more stringy and chewier Similar flavor and still edible so its okay I would definitely buy the larger sticks though
1,I personally enjoy this tea at work and I get at least one cup every day I really recommend it
1,This was an impulse buy for me I was looking for a lavender herb blend and while this has no lavender in it my research concludes that herbs de provence should not contain lavenderlavender is often added as a touristyAmericansnobby thing Ive used this in spaghetti sauce  delicious Ive also used it with just olive oil lemon and parmesan on pasta excellent It has added nice flavor to soup and stew as well I think its the savory that makes everything I put it on taste so good One tip is a must when using any dried herb be sure to rub it roughly between your palms to break out the freshness It will now be a staple in my spice library
-1,Ick This stuff is disgustingwhy anyone would subject themselves to Natures Sports Drink is beyond me If youre looking for coconut water at least choose the brand without all the added ingredients
1,Having used Kal Red Star and then this brand I must say that these have a less desirable flavor than the before mentioned brands They smell different and taste slightly different I will probably go back to the Kal brand
1,Kids love these and so easy to make  They are a little different than the kraft stuff but not bad  Would buy again  In fact I have bought these 4 times now
1,A few weeks ago one of my friends made me a cup of tea  I really like it  I was sick and it help clear me out  Highly suggested
1,I cannot drink a lot of strong tea while nursing My metabolism is all messed up This tea is strong tasting enough that it feels like a good cup of tea It does seem to increase supply so I do not use if engorged There is an anisette flavor in it Not a flavor I am normally fond of but I dont mind it in this tea
-1,Im a South Asian I know how real true chai is made That being said this chai is overwhelming with the clove flavor Authentic spice chai includes cardamon lots of it and this is lacking in that There is an extremely subtle coconut flavor but its barely there Overall I hate this stuff Its way to heavy on the clove taste and light on everything else
1,An update for July 2012Have ordered this assortment 4 times since my original review which I deleted to edit and add a new reviewThe company is now listing what you get in the packageCase of 60 Assorted Snack Size Bags The snack size bags range from 34 oz to 114 oz The assortment includes Regular BBQ Sour Cream  Onion Salt  Vinegar Crab and Kettle Classic potato chips Thin pretzels Cheese Curls White Cheddar popcorn and Party MixI am very glad to see thisIts no longer a wait and see what you get purchaseHowever you do still get more of some types than othersA very good product but the dates usually range from 4 to 8 weeksCould be longer but still a great price and the few that I have eaten after the past best by date I could tell no differenceI hope these stay on site for sale because they have become a regular purchase for me
1,Pretty good and fulfilling Its a good choice for road trips Its nice for those of us that eat organic and gluten free which makes it hard to find something to eat on the road these fill the need
-1,I bought 5 different varieties of Yogi tea and find that this blend is the most tolerable of the Yogi teas I have had so far  I dont care for the stevia at all there is a taste that really turns me off and I believe it is the stevia but  they use so many ingredients in their teas that it is hard to pinpoint the actual villian  We use stevia at home but it seems that stevia in processed products takes on a weirder flavour  to me anyways  I do not find that this tea relaxes me either but something in it feels like a stimulant  I will go back to my valerian stinky but simple clean and relaxing
1,I have been purchasing and drinking this tea for yearsIn fact since Mo Siegel used to advertise it on TVnow that is a long time ago It really helps calm frazzled adults as well as hyper children before bed But what is more share worthy is the fact that it is a great tea for children that suffer from motion sicknessOur oldest daughter used to be car sick all the time We carried an endless supply of baggies for her as she would 8 out of 10 times relieve herself when commuting back and forth to schoolWe discovered that this tea given 20 minutes before the ride and every hour or so on long family trips curtailed her horrid events completely The main ingredient is chamomile and it really helps relieve motion sickness and soothe frazzled nerves
1,This is just another in a long line of terrific yogi teas I usually keep a teapot full of this tea and add it to my orange juice based smoothie in the morning  it adds a nice hint of mintI recently read that adding a citrus juice to green tea multiplies the benefits of the antioxidants in the tea  this tea goes very well with orange juice
-1,So I thought fresh meant I could eat it out of the box much like I would fresh apples and pears Apparently not After devouring three pounds of fresh whole rabbit out of the box I have spent the last week in the hospital Be sure to read the instructions Apparently you have to cook the rabbit
1,I use this as an additive to green tea or oolong  Its a soothing addition that takes it up a notch
1,I got these out of curiosity I like Meiji brand chocolates but had only really had the mushroom  and bambooshaped ones The box is pretty small and rather banged up but it didnt affect the contents Its quite difficult not to eat the whole thing in one sitting The chocolate has a sweet dark chocolate flavor but not overly sweet The strawberry flavor is more of a hint but strong enough to still know its there Overall it was a nice balanced flavor I would get them again I wish they were easier to come by locally
1,There is double the taste when you get the organic honey  I ate one pound in a month just in my coffees  Very cheap if you look around
1,I try to always have a loaf of bread in the freezer for my daughter who has a gluten intolerance  We prefer the taste of this glutenfree flour over others Ive used so far so I also use the mix without yeast to replace almost anything that I used regular flour for in the pastto make gravies hush puppies breading for things like chicken fried steak etc
-1,HFCS  High Fructose Corn Syrup  is processed differently by your body than sugar and is considerably worse Do not trust the propaganda of the subsidized Big Ag in America for your truthful info on foodYou can get an organic version from Annies
1,If my wife drinks a cup of this tea when she feels an attack coming on it often helps her avoid the attack at all If we are out and she has an attack drinking this tea has lessened the effects and helped her recover more quicklyWe have tried other tinctures and teas but his blend from TM has been wonderful It tastes great I enjoy it  myself and it is an effective breathing aidof course this is not medical advice this N1 experience
1,This is actually the best coffeemate there is when you consider it has less tan one gram of fat less than one gram of carbohydrates and 34034 sugars in it  Just check out the fat free and sugar free flavored coffeemates and youll be shocked to find they have twice the fat carbohydrates and sugars then  just the regular old  coffeemate LolBesides I dont want flavors in my coffee to mask the coffee flavor  I like the taste of deep robust coffee and this regular coffee mate gives me that creamy coffee flavor I like
-1,I buy Coconut Water for as my hydration drink because of its Potassium contents nutrient good for the muscles after workout But I found a different brand that has more Potassium This brand has less Potassium content per serving
-1,I purchased these BIG FRANKS after reading the positive reviews and after enjoying other LOMA LINDA products  I have NO idea what the 5star reviewers ate because I could barely stomach these pseudofood products  Im not sure what to do with the remaining cans because relish catsup onions mustard and tons of other toppings failed to camouflage the rubbery offtaste of these franks  My conclusion is that I think Ill eat all the condiments and dispense with this redgrey monstrosityUPDATE After reading responses to my review I realize that the way to appreciate these franks is to eat them during childhood WHEN YOU DONT KNOW ANY BETTER sorry just kidding I couldnt resist  Okay If you dont acquire a taste for these during your imprintable years be cautious about buying them now  Youve been warned  GOOD LUCK
-1,Texas Petes is the 1 hot sauce in the South  its ubiquitous in every type of restaurant  If you ask for Tabasco youre likely to get Texas Petes hot sauce instead  The company was founded in 1929 in WinstonSalem North Carolina their first product was their barbecue sauce but the hot sauce soon followed  This is a basic hot sauce  peppers vinegar and salt  and it can be used as you would Tabasco or a Louisiana hot sauce  Unfortunately its extremely mild  I often find that in order to add the desired heat to food I have to add so much that the food becomes watery  My scrambled eggs end up a mess and still taste bland  If you like a mild hot sauce then Texas Pete should be one of your top choices  Otherwise avoid this wimpy selectionThe companys website includes a plethora of recipes using their products  the Chicken Brunswick Stew is a North Carolina tradition
1,This is a minimally processed 100 organic green tea which preserves the antioxidant and polyphenol content of the leaves  The flavor is very mild but pleasant  Its a refreshing hot cup of low caffeine tea  I highly recommend it to everyone but especially those wanting a healthful drink for any time of the day
-1,I bought these Natures Hallow Sugar Free Bllueberry Jams last year and they were really delicious  Plus they were sugar free with all natural and organic xylitol for sweetener  BUTI just purchased a case of them and they were grossly spoiled  One jar arrived opened and leaking all over the package so I threw it out  The second and third jars I opened were thick with globs of fungus encrusted blueberrys and smelled awful  Needless to say I threw them outthats thirty dollars wasted  A fourth jar smelled ok and after tasting a little of it to make sure it wouldnt make me sick it turned out to be okat least I am still hoping so  I am actually afraid to open the remaining jars  Its like the company had a few really old jars left and sent them to me to clean out their inventory  Well I can tell you that they have lost me as a customer  I use to buy their cookies for my old uncle but NO MORE  He is old and might not recognize if they are spoiled loaded with fungus or rancid  I wont be responsible for his demise by buying from an unethical company  I already told the company about the opened jar upon arrival but I hadnt opened any more at that time  I dont expect to hear from them  I definitely DO NOT recommend this company any more  Beware
1,This is one of the only bars that truly keeps me full I eat a whole bar and it stays with me for hours The taste of espresso is really delicious and especially great if you eat this as a morning meal bar I loved it from the first bite Some of these bars contain peanuts so be sure to check the label before you order or consume if you have allergies While you will not be tricked into thinking you are eating a decadent treat this bar really does the trick in filling you up so you dont go ahead and indulge in a decadent treat
-1,Rice noodles have OODLES of flavor when cookedsteamed  Absolutely no flavor at all  Indian grocery stores carry better noodles that soak in boiled water for 10 minutes  Or you can make FRESH ones if you have rice grains
-1,I did not feel this was a good product it just seemed to make everything I used it on runny might be good for soups but thats about all in my opinion
-1,Below was my original review however since theyve been bought out by KelloggKashi the quality and taste has completely gone downhill There are barely any fruitsnuts merely just flavoring I was a Bear Naked customer for years but no longerThis is a great natural snack food Has lots of good stuff in it and is great as a midafternoon snack between lunch and dinner While it may be healthy it is not a lowfat food and though it can be easy to eat the entire bag one needs to pay attention to that That said it is delicious
1,Wow this tea is about half the price of one of the other best selling brands even with paying for shipping and it is all hibiscus  Back in the day I used the Alvita brand and got it from my health food store since closed and I started lazy me picking up whatever was available at the supermarket  Then voila I find Alvita on Amazon  Done
-1,I was aboslutely shocked to see how much 1 oz really was At 760 I mistakenly assumed it would be a decent sized can As locally I am able to buy a medium sized tube of wasabi paste for around 3 but never used it fast enough so it would get old I figured a powder would be better so I can mix it as I needed it When I opened the box and dug thru the packing and saw this little little can I started looking for the hidden cameras   thought this HAD to be a joke Nope  and its NOT returnable either SO I HAVE LEARNED MY LESSON Please just be aware if you should decide you want this EXPENSIVE wasabi powder
1,I will preface this review with a little about myself I only recently bought a hottest sauce while at a kind of flea market in England It was also a ghost pepper sauce and i was shocked at the intensity of the burn At first I was sort of proud of myself for being able to use it but it did grow on me and I started using it as an actual condiment  After the bottle ran out I thought I would see what was on Amazon and this sauce was ranked very highly so I bought it So I really only have one other sauce to compare this to but here goesThe sauce is very hot Almost too hot It has a pasty consistency almost exactly like tomato paste Very finely ground It has a more gummy consistency to it like theres something added to it to give it a smoother texture though theres no such actual ingredientWhat there is however as someone else pointed out is pepper extract Its the second listed ingredient so there must be a considerable amount Perhaps its whats giving this sauce that slimy texture I was eluding to earlier This Pepper Extract doesnt state what KIND of pepper and as its an extract I imagine it must have gone through quite the extraction processSo what Im getting at is this the sauce feels more like a pepper extract something which you should add small amounts of to large dishes for adding pure spice to the food But its missing the taste and feel of an actual hot sauce Theres little flavor just a lot of burn And I have to say that thats a big shame because the bhut jolokia pepper is very tasty Almost fruity if I remember correctlySo I give this hot sauce 4 stars for the Effort and the level of spice but I wont give it 5 stars because I think that goes to the generic bhut jolokia ghost pepper sauces with all the scary names and pictures on the bottle The one I had was Fear Hot Sauce with a scary ghost woman on it and it was much more like salsa with little ground up pieces of ghost peppers and seeds in it and equal to if not more burn than this oneIf I change my mind as I go through this bottle Ill update or comment on here again
1,Good but dangerous to have around Love that these are sugar free Taste great Hate that these are not a low calorie food and are dangerous to the waistline
1,We have chickens for fresh eggs but in storing up for long term food storage and for using in baking this is an awesome idea  Now we are spoiled with our fresh eggs but if using these dry ones and if a person mixes something in with them for an egg scramble they become okay  Its all in what you add and how you season and lets face it they are dry so nothing will taste like the real thing  Dry goods like this are awesome because you can make your own mixes ahead of time and just add liquid which saves a lot of time if you are in a pinchI recommend everyone have some on their shelf
1,These are exactly what they are good salted cashews Theyre as good as you get prepackaged as opposed to fresh roasted in a store I like the singlesize serving packs to keep me from overeating the nuts Only problem has been they can get stale soon after their expiration date if you havent used them up and expiration is usually short  like 2  3 months I dont always eat that many packets a week
1,These corn flakes are really good My son wasnt crazy about most of the other kinds He is a newly diagnosed special needs kid It was hard at first since he was used to regular gluten foods But he has adapted well Good price too
1,These are a great alternative to the usual cheesecracker snacks  I feel as though were being healthier and the taste seems so much fresher  It doesnt have that chemical after taste  These would be great for smaller children as the cracker sizes are so small
-1,I purchased the High Protein Pretzels  Ive had Newmans Own Organic Pretzels before and they tasted great  but these are not good at all  95 of the salt is at the bottom of the bag have to have salt on pretzels and they have an overwhelming flavor of being burnt and not a good burnt either  I have no use now for all these pretzels and i cant imagine anyone enjoying this tasteIt is upsetting to see that a few others also ended up with the High Protein pretzels having this awful BURNT flavor and yet they still kept sending them out  Id think maybe theyd look at batch numbers or something to prevent them from being shipped out to dissatisfied customers who will give it a bad reviewGenerally Newmans Pretzels are really good but buy these at your own risk
1,This brand is a favorite of mine Good quality almond extract Great price The bottle showed up in perfect condition as well
1,This is a great substituent for soy sauce  I might not be a soy aficionado because I cant tell the difference I dont feel any guilt using as much as I want
-1,This popcorn was okay but it was WAY too salty for me  I think they should change the simply salted to say seasoned with salt or nuthin but salt something that indicates that this is a very salty product
-1,Im always appalled to see fellow diabetics extoll the virtues of many sugar free products because many of them contain a substance called maltodextrin which is every bit as bad if not worse than cane sugar for causing super spikes in blood glucoseNotice in the ingredients list the first two ingredients are a modified food starch and maltodextrin made from corn Sostarch and corn which is also a starch The way the law reads those who produce food products dont have to add certain substances to the nutrition information they only have to list them in the ingredient list Ingredient lists always go from most to least and by that I mean the first item on the list makes up more of the product than anything else The second item is the 2nd most and so on so this sugar free jello is primarily made up of starch and maltodextrin from corn and if that wasnt bad enough youre going to add milk to this product which is more simple carbs There are over 11 grams of carbs in 1 cup of milk You would be much better off to just eat a regular sized chocolate bar than to eat this sugar free productThis product might say in the nutrition information that its sugar free and carb free but that obviously is NOT TRUE because the ingredients say its not true Theyve added food starch and maltodextrinMy endocrinologist said that pretty much everyone should try to avoid ingesting very much maltodextrin but especially if you are diabetic prediabetic have a family history of diabetes or are pregnant gestational diabetesThe really sad thing is that much of the time maltodextrin adds NOTHING to the product  not flavor certainly not nutrition It is a cheap low calorieno calorie fillerMaltodextrin is in sugar free jello sugar free jello pudding many sugar free hot beverage mixes such as Maxwell House sugar free coffee drink mixes and its in many sugar free liquid coffee creamers and I could go on and on Please if you are diabetic READ the label and not just the nutrition infoWhen I was diagnosed with diabetes in January 2012 my average blood sugar was in the 290s and my A1C was a whopping 117I figured out on my own that maltodextrin was bad and began researching it Once I cut out all products with maltodextrin in them my blood sugar readings quickly normalized and when I went back to my physician at the beginning of April 2012 my A1C was 65 so I was able to reduce it to a much better level within just a few months I could never have done that without cutting out the maltodextrinAnother bad thing about maltodextrin is it can adversely affect your appetite Anytime you have big fluctuations in your blood sugar it also causes fluctuations in appetite which can make it hard to stick with any kind of eating programIve been following a low carbhigh fiber diet for years now because my husband though a normal weight and very active was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes almost a decade ago I was sort of shocked when I was diagnosed with it and Ill always wonder if we had just known about substances like maltodextrin that react so negatively on the pancreas if I could have avoided the disease or at least held it off until later in life and I cried when I realized that all this time Ive been buying sugar free stuff for my husband thinking it was okay because his nutritionist never said a WORD about maltodextrin and other substances like dextrose sorbitol etc that also react on the pancreas and the reality is that I was making his diabetesinsulin resistance WORSEI hope this helps someone out there Wish Id have known about it much sooner
-1,I am not a fan of these lemon cookies  I love other Pams cookies but these have a too strong lemon flavor and thats all I taste  I still have most of the case and I may just throw them out
1,When I was growing up split pea soup was a uniform slurry of slowcooked peas flavored with a ham bone that would sometimes have small pieces of ham andor carrots added in to serve This is a different beast but its quite good The base is that same split pea soup I know but theres a lot of whole peas not too mushy which is nice potatoes carrots and chunks of ham It really eats more like a stew than a pea soup but its flavorful and fillingThe only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is the quality of the meat Its not bad but its not 5stars either A bit tough and not enough fat content to be interesting its really just a textural variation in the stew
-1,The brand of Senseo that came with my little coffee pod machine was stronger than I liked so I tried a four pack of Columbiacoffee and the first pod was so strong that it upset my stomach  The next two were terrible and I dumped both cups  Since then I have tried diluting  each pod with some water but the rotten taste persists  I bought a large coffee at a popular drive in and it was really strong and would have been refused back in the WWII era  NEEDLESS TO SAY NEVER ANOTHER SENSEO COFFEE POD IN MY HOUSE EVER AGAINI dont blame Amazon for my mistakes but it really irks me to throw out twenty some dollars worth of worthless SENSEO coffee pods  Will keep the pod machine to heat water for tea  My suggestion is for people to buy coffee and filters from your local stores at least most of it is drinkable and so much cheaper
1,This is amazing stuff Make my own Miso soup regularly and would be lost without this stuff The local market had it but I guess no one ever bought it so it sat there for a few years while the package degradedOrdered it from Amazon and got a new package and a fresh product Perfect Dashi my friends told me it was the best Miso soup they ever had
-1,After an initial positive experience with the product I ordered a second pack of 8 The first pouch we opened was fine however the second was where we encountered a problem The meat in the bottom of the package was covered in a thick nasty mold I reached in and was about to take bite when I noticed the mold covering it Im guessing the seal must have somehow broke on the packaging Just make sure you check before eating
-1,A sampler box is a good idea when it comes to tea However this selection includes some strange flavors including licorice which can be found in many of the types the box offers If that is not your cup of tea no pun intended a third of the box will be useless for you The bags are of poor quality too They fall apart much of the time 
1,I suffer from IBSC and often find myself in need of both fiber supplements andor something else to get things moving I find this tea to be a gentle and tasty way to do just that
-1,Sorry but it does not make it very very very  thats three verys weak taste  Basically water with a hint of Coconut
-1,To be fair Im not a fan of boxed Macaroni and Cheese Id rather make it with the real stuff But I was curious how veggie pasta would taste I cant say this tasted any better than regular boxed mac and cheese Didnt care for it
1,This is the most incredible almond extract Ive ever purchased I put it in everything including my coffee to make chemical free almond coffeea much better alternative than Dunkin
1,This tea has a lovely flavor and has no caffeine so I can drive throughout the day  Its good for those of us who like the taste of anise but enjoy something a little spicier
-1,These cookies are essentially tasteless  I do eat them but after one the consistency is weird kind of mushy The Betty Crocker chocolate chip mix is a zillion times betterexcept you have to bake 
1,Its Kraft Mac and Cheese We all know what its like The great thing about this order was the price
-1,Their Golden is golden but not a fan of this version  Just too burnt bitter a taste for me  If your buds leans toward the grilled flavors then you might like this however
-1,i thought id like it but its too bitter and dark chocolate tasting for me my parents love this stuff but they like dark chocolate too there was nothing wrong with the packaging or container i was just expecting something more like chocolate and peanut butter  which this is not
-1,The noodles etc  were good  but the peanut sauce smelled odious and tasted worse  I am making my own to get the rest 0f the portions down
-1,These K Cups brew a very mild cup which is OK sometimes but I have found that about one in six produces a very weak tealike swill Not good The price is below that of my favorite brew Pike Place Starbucks always good but you get what you pay for If I have to dump one of every six cups the bargain loses its shine I will not reorder this brand
-1,Quite frankly we think this soup is disgusting  There is no flavor to it whatsoever and if I accidentally buy it hoping a different flavor will be better my husband who eats ANYTHING just groans and chokes it down  The only thing good about it is that it does have more stuff in it to fill you up but just no taste  After you dump about a pound of salt into them they resemble something with some flavor but not really  Its healthy all right but there are many other products out there that are just as healthy but have all the flavor as well  If you dont like spices then this is your soup  However since I make my own and were more used to flavor this one just doesnt cut the broth
1,I hate honey but I love Bit O Honey candy I really dont taste the honey in them I like the bars better than the individually wrapped candies because the shape is easier to eat I like them hard brittle and chewy not soft This is actually cheaper per bar than where I buy them locally
1,For years I have used that other hot sauce that is in every supermarket That one has a lot of spice but not much flavor Then I discovered Cholula in a restaurant in ColoradoCholula Hot Sauce is in a different class It is hot but has quite good flavor I have found that it can be used to add spice to tomato juice It also goes well on my homemade guacamole and enchiladas
1,I could EASILY gain 1520lbs from Halloween until New Years Day so this year my husband and I decided to try not to go overboard on all the cookiescandy that is so availableI bought these cookies thinking they would be a poor substitute but SURPRISE they really do have a huge chocolately taste and while they wont take the place of homemade fudge or gourmet chocolates they are still satisfyingThey are tiny not much bigger than a life saver really and come in 80 calorie packages so I dont have to worry about portion control Also it can be hard to get enough fiber in your diet every day so I like the fact that these have 3 grams of fiber per package My husband is a type II diabetic and these do have 16 grams of carbs but because of the fiber they dont spike his blood sugarThe only downside to these is they do have 3g sugar alcohol which can cause some people stomach upsetIm still probably going to have goodies this holiday season but with these cookies in my pantry I know I wont indulge as often
-1,I bought these for just under 15 a few months ago  They are now over 32  This is for 8 bowls of macaroni and cheese  DO NOT BUY AT THIS PRICE
1,First let me say Im from the Caribbean and finding packaged coconut water that actually tastes like coconut water has been difficult  Ive gotten both the regular Natural and chocolate flavored Zico and they are both great  The natural doesnt have that sour dirty laundry water taste that others have 338ozWhen I first tried the chocolate 14oz I drank it pretty close to room temperature and I wasnt that impressed  Icy cold straight from the fridge however the chocolate is amazing  It is like a good for you Yoohoo is that spelled right drink without all the sugar  Add a littleOmega Nutrition Pumpkin Seed Protein Powder 21Ounceprotein powder to the 14oz bottle shake up and youre good for a breakfast on the runAs a side note I also like the taste of theTaste Nirvana Real Coconut Water With Pulp 162Ounce Pack of 12andCoCo Libre Organic Coconut Water 11Ounce Pack of 12Absolutely HATE the taste of either plain or flavored Vita Coco
-1,I hate the new version which is watered down with chamomile and not effective at all  The previous senna one was extremely effective but NO longer available at all  I stopped buying it as soon as the company added chamomile and it is now useless  Why do companies change something that already worked in the freakin first place  What a shame The box they show on this is the old one but I bet if I ordered it they would send me that crappy new stuff  Also Amazon needs to offer a Zero star option as that is what I would give this new versiona big fat zero
1,This is a light and tasty seasoning that would be good on almost anything for which one normally uses salt or other seasonings I like the fact that it doesnt contain salt so there is no reason to limit its use I would definitely recommend this product
1,Definitely worth every penny Nice and fresh tasting Much better than paying the price of the smaller bags Only issue I ran into was that the seal on the bag didnt work on my bag So I put it into other containers which stunk
-1,I bought this tea on a whim thinking it would be perfect for this autumn and winter When I opened the box the smell was fantastic I had such high hopes for this tea but was sorely disappointed It was much too sweet for me I was expecting something that was heavily spiced but it seems like the apple flavor is more prominentI didnt want it to go to waste so I experimented trying different things in hopes that my taste buds would be satisfied I tried steeping it for a short period of time making iced tea adding a splash of milk adding more cinnamon etc Nothing seemed to do it for me I really wanted to like this tea because it smells so great but I guess Ill be on the lookout for something else
1,I love this tea it is so yummy and I love that it is organic  And it is cheaper than buying Raspberry Leaf tea at the store  Plus I cant find Raspberry Leaf anywhere buy health food stores or Whole Foods so it is nice to get it on Amazon  I was paying 5 or more for a box of tea  This tea is supposed to help with female reproduction and toning the uterus which is why I drink it all day long
1,The flavor and scent of this is wonderful Its smooth yet has a cinnamon spice to it I feel so great after a cup its a great pick me up in the afternoon
-1,As soon as I had a couple of sips my eczema started uncontrollably itching Thats one of the signs when something I eat is NOT glutenfree Will return the item for a refund
-1,Yuck  This has GOT to be the worse tasting bar I have ever eaten  It tastes like you are chocking down a bunch of chemicals Yes yes I KNOW it says all natural but really its gross I looked up the ingredient list the ingredient list IS on the back of the bar but on my bar Amazon stuck a sticker right on top of it and it maybe a form of natural ingredients or maybe what USE TO BE natural ingredients but its not anymoreAlso if you are really looking to avoid products such as MSG and GMOs this bar isnt for you  Soyand Canola are both now primarily GMO unless its organic  If you arent familiar with GMOs its a good time to learn about them and decide for yourself if its something you want to consume  Im not here to tell you one way or another but Ive made the decision to avoid it as much as possibleAnd regarding Natural Flavors  What I have heard is Natural Flavors is industry term ingredients which can contain MSG and  or AspartameJust doing a bit of research on the ingredient list of this bar I cant see how Think Thin can get away with calling itself All Natural  It really should be called Deprived from Natural Ingredients or What was once natural ingredients but now is in a unrecognizable formINGREDIENTS PROTEIN BLEND WHEY PROTEIN ISOLATE SOY PROTEIN ISOLATE CALCIUM CASEINATE CASEIN GLYCERIN COATING MALTITOL COCOA BUTTER CHOCOLATE SODIUM CASEINATE MILK FAT SOY LECITHIN NATURAL FLAVORS SALT MALTITOL ALKALIZED COCOA COCOA SOY CRISPS SOY PROTEIN ISOLATE ALKALIZED COCOA TAPIOCA STARCH PEANUTS WATER CANOLA OIL NATURAL FLAVORS SOY LECITHIN COFFEECONTAINS MILK PEANUTS SOYMANUFACTURED IN A PLANT THAT ALSO PROCESSES EGGS AND TREE NUTSGLUTEN FREE Certified Gluten Free by GFCO gfcoorgMaltitol is a sugar alcohol and is artificially produced according to various sourcesSodium caseinate is the biochemical name for casein Casein is the name for a family of related phosphoproteins  These proteins are commonly found in milkFor 230 calories a bar and 20 grams of protein I think a person could do better for their body and have something tastier to eat  Perhaps a few eggs
-1,This is not the same as Ativa Dandelion tea  This one feels a little weird and honestly I dont suggest it
-1,I have consumed two boxes of this and my milk supply has dramatically decreased  I am trying to isolate any other potential variables and will try to stick with it since I have 4 boxes left but I am disappointed  Also this has Anise in it so it you like black licorice you should enjoy the taste  I however strongly dislike black licorice and have a very difficult time drinking it  If my supply increases later I will come back and change this review otherwise this has been a waste of money and a bad tasting experimentUpdate my review stayed  I will be throwing the last couple of boxes away  Not work my time or money Too bad
1,This macaroni  cheese is heavenly Even people who are not gluten intolerant love it at our house I add nothing to it but a bit of extra butter and we are very happy with it Makes being glutenfree pretty darned easyOur only complaint why I didnt give it five stars is there just doesnt seem to be much here for the price Kraft boxes are over 7 ounces these are six and the cost is well over double for the glutenfree It takes several boxes to feed a family or at least two if you have little portionswhich we dont
-1,I bought this on a lightning deal and am very disappointed If you want bagged high quality chamomile tea stick to allflowers highquality potent Traditional Medicinals brand This producedgoing by their exact instructions and a couple of variationsa browner tea than pure chamomile flowers produce darker in this case does NOT mean potentchamomile is golden and it should only ever become a more saturated yellow if steeped at rich concentrations never even approaching brown or apple cider type coloration and just as crucially it tasted more twiggy and was far less aromatic with nearly none of the sweet applecherimoya tastes than any good chamomileWhile I do tend to brew loose teaam picky about the actual bags used by any given brand chemical bleaching will destroy all tea bags are nearly essential when my time to get tea is limited to pouring water over the tea and covering it to steep at my work area and another ten seconds to squeeze the bag out and toss the tea Still I wont be taking this anywherethe two unused boxes will go to a food bank since Im sure someone will appreciate it if only as something hot and free of caffeine Frankly Celestial Seasonings makes tea better than the two Alvita singleingredient options I purchasedOne thing I tend to do with every new tea  try is analyze the actual tea itself always wet but often dry as well This ones prominence of stems a 15cm one punctured the bag in pushing out the liquid with a spoon against the little ramekin lid I cover my cups with the dusty brown flecks of what I presume are chamomile flowersvery poorly handled onesand the end result leave me writing a review urging you to go elsewhere If you want bagged tea Traditional Medicinals chamomilewhich is all flower twice as flavor and nutrientrich as Alvita gram for gram and can be steeped essentially indefinitelytil the bag breaks down without becoming bitter which is true of nearly all pure chamomilethat isnt treated with pesticides or in treated bags etc especially Egyptian varieties is so far the best Ive found Two bags of this cannot compete with ONE of theirs and if you steep Alvita beyond a few minutes your tea will be bitter and woodytannins and other bitter components are from the stems not the flowerIf you are able and willing to do the extra minute of work getting loose WHOLE Egyptian chamomile flowers whose quality you can visibly assess including how long theyve been sitting around is by far your best betcheapest too and a Chinese tea gallery can sell you a cute little handled doublelayer mesh strainer for a few dollarsI personally use my Pyrex measuring cups to steep so I can easily pour the golden in this caseiodine red or kiwi green or whatever other shade it turns out liquid into my drinking vessel and if the ingredients are suited to multiple steepings like oolong or puehr steep again without too much awkwardnessThe tldr essence of this look elsewherethis is extremely poor chamomile whether you ask me a diligent grower or an expertthis is not advertised as twiggy tea itd be the wrong component anyway and you likely arent looking for an infusion from taking boiling water to haylike splintery stems For shame Alvita For shameTry this instead B0009F3PM6Traditional Medicinals OrganicChamomile 16Count BoxesPack of 6You wont regret it
-1,Absolutely horrid  I love Zico in the tetra paks  Its the best packaged coconut water Ive tasted  However this product in the bottle had the worst plastic taste imaginable  I cant believe Zico would put out a product that tastes this bad  Maybe it was stored under poor conditions but I will never buy Zico in this format ever again
1,Panda licorice There is not too much I can say about panda licorice Its very good thats why I keep on buying it
1,I have been experimenting with different flavors using spices and herbs and other condiments  I havent had a lot of experience with different chili peppers so this was a great way to sample the chilies in a variety of forms  Id recommend it as a gift for novice cooks who like their food with varying degrees of heat
1,I never saw them except for the picture she sent  It didnt look as good as the stock photo though  I ordered it on Tuesday and it arrived on Friday even though the tracking for it said it would be Monday or Tuesday  She said the cold packs were still cold when it arrived  They didnt look great when they showed up but she said they drank tons of water when she put them in a vase and perked up and looked great afterwards I order from them again in the future
-1,The product description says that this tea is slightly sweet as well as a bunch of other descriptors but I didnt get any sweetness at all I was very optimistic because I normally love everything Tazo offers but this time I had my hopes dashedI brewed up a mug of this tea and was immediately alarmed at the bouquet The teabag smelled different but once the hot water hit it the smell seemed to really magnify But I scooped in a few teaspoons of sugar and hoped for the best I managed to choke down about a third of the cup before I called it a day Life is too short to drink something you dont likeHowever I had read a review that mentioned how good and palatable this tea was when combined with the Tazo Lotus I figured it was worth a shot otherwise Id have to throw out this tea altogetherThe Lotus smelled great so I was excited I blended the two bags one Lotus and one Wild Sweet Orange in a large mug then removed the Wild Sweet Orange after a minute I left the Lotus in for another minute or two yeah definitely twoThe result was a very unusual but not unappealing beverage Would I drink this more than once a day No Was it very interesting and something that Ill try again YesLive and learn I guess
-1,I used to love the old Zico when it went straight from the coconut into the container  Now that its made from concentrate it tastes weak and spoiled  This will be my last box of ever of Zico  Ill be going back to ONE or Vita Coco
-1,Im hopping mad just seeing this We should all paws for a second and lettuce think about this Wouldnt you really just rather have a chicken Im all ears if someone disagrees
-1,I thought formula might be handy on the go but the baby hates this stuff Shes fine with breast milk cow milk and some other formulas Shell prett much eat anthing foodwise Surprised by her disgust after drinking a sip I gave it a sniff and a taste myself Its dreadful really metallic tasting Not sure if soy formulas always like this but I have to admit I was pretty surprised it tasted like anything by sugar after reading the ingredients2 stars instead of 1 because it does mix up really easilyIf your baby has taken formula from the getgo they may be more tolerant We have encountered other really tinny ones from the endless stream of Enfamil samples so I dont think its altogether rare
1,Ive used this product for years  not for dieting but for morning regularity  I enjoy a cup of tea each night before bedtime and am assured of daily relief  lol  I prefer the Apricot flavor  but other flavor choices are available  depending on ones preference  Purchasing thru Amazon has always been more costworthy and shipping always prompt
-1,It tastes mildly of chocolate with the addition of stevia in it  The problem though is the dental hygienist pointed out at my last cleaning that my teeth are getting unusually stained from something new Im eating or drinking  I mentioned purchasing a ton of this tea from Amazon and she was pretty sure that was the source since I dont normally have this issue  As a result Ive mostly quit drinking it
1,Kadoya Sesame Oil is delicious with a deep dark full sesame taste Unlike many sesame oils which are watered down this one is the real thing Great for all Asianstyle cooking
1,I put this in the category of super spicy sauces  but  I dont think it is by any means too spicyFlavor isnt too bad a sort of smoky tomato base flavor  More than anything the heat comes throughThis is pretty good for spicing up soups chilies etc  However not really all that good for spicing up a sandwich or something not because it is too hot just dont care for the flavor that much straight upAll said this is better than your average super spicy sauce  Most seem to just have the awful capsaicin extract flavor and nothing else which to me is inedible due to the terrible taste not even the heat  Daves really isnt bad but not my favorite either
1,A bit small in portion but great tasting Good for an afternoon pick me up
1,I cant really remember ever having a bad cup of Green Mountain Coffee and any of their Keurig kcups Ive tried have been good
-1,Meh not that great Comes out too thick and gloppy  More of a chemical than cheesy taste Not really recommended
-1,Dehydration directions say that you need guar gum  I just added the required water in order to mix it in with a recipe and it came out like water  The guar gum is a thickener like cornstarch  Flavor wise I think it tastes like sheep or goat milkIm not sure but I dont like it
1,We love this cereal both parents child and toddler  Unlike many other Gluten Free cereals it contains a bit more fiber which if you are Celiac you understand why I mention that  The fiber content is not overly high so I would gather that it has more to do with the flax  It is a good crispy cereal with a fairly mild flavor which is slightly sweet  The one peculiar thing is that even though it tastes great the smell is not as pleasant as the taste  This is also likely because of the flax  And if it gets past the expiration date you will know it nasty odor  That said it is probably the best organic gluten free cereal we have found that has more nutritional value  Unfortunately many GF cereals seem to lack nutritional content  Buying it by the case from Amazon using Subscribe and Save is hands down the best deal I have found  Hopefully someday Natures Path will make the Vanilla and Maple flavored Mesa Sunrises in the economy size too
-1,Its a below average rooibos red tea which is still priced to make it a great deal Go for this tea if you are a deal hunter Not recommend for a true tea lover
-1,I opened my box and found that one of the box of crackers had been open and removed The crackers came in the wrong size and some were cracked I was raging mad but the quiet kind of mad that leaves one feeling homicidal i want a new box of crackers or my money back which ever comes first So disappointed so very disappointed ONE GREAT BIG FAT STAR
-1,These cookies are very rich oily and smell so strong that you can smell them through a ziplock bag We wont buy these again They didnt taste very good
-1,There is something just completely wrong with the way the bacon bits that are packaged with the Velveeta Shells and Cheese taste  Additionally the cheese sauce does not taste the same as the regular Shells and Cheese sauce and not in a good way  Stick with the original
-1,1 these candy bars were apparently made for overseas distribution but never got there  I ordered from a company in Mass figuring that all the reviews talking about candy with asianindian language on the wrapper might be avoided but it was not  Seems you will get these overseas bars wherever you get them from2 I wanted the VIOLET CRUMBLE but it is not available in the US anymore  Some reviewed these and said these bars were close to if not better than the VC  I disagree greatly  Although they are both a form of sponge candy with a chocolate covering this bar does not come close to the VIOLET CRUBMLE  The sponge center only makes me think the word STALE and the chocolate has something wrong with it  Not even close to the quality of the chocolate used on the VC  Indeed after just a small sampling from the first bar I was so disappointed I tossed them all in the garbageToo bad  Guess Ill keep on looking for the VC  Hail Flavius
-1,These were by far the worst peanuts I have ever tried They are hot but taste nothing like chili My son didnt like them either They werent even edible with beer
-1,Im a fan of just about all Newmans Own products so when I caught a sale on this popcorn 36 bags for lt12  even though Id never tried it I assumed it would be delicious Wrong This popcorn is completely flavorless which I could actually tolerate by adding my own butter and extra salt  if not for the unpopped kernels in every single bite Not such a great deal for me afterall
-1,Not at all what I wanted from a shortbread cookie  They had a cold wet feel  Very dense not buttery not crisp  Terrible texture
-1,I agree with scootser this drink is far too sweet and I have a gigantic sweet tooth so if its too sweet for me then it is too sweet for a lot of people41g of total carbohydrates170 calories for a 84 oz canI should have known that the meyer lemon juice was going to be too sweet when I read the nutritional facts but there were so many great reviews I decided to give it a try anyway Bad decision Drinking this juice is like drinking a liquid lemon drop with a bitter aftertaste If that sounds terrible to you and believe me it is then dont buy this juice
1,Really flavourful and tasty without being overpowering or too strong Faintly sweet too Love it
1,this is a great tasting soup cooked in minutes and great on the run i just wish you can get more cups for the price but over still great
1,I tried many many other boxed gluten free dinners none of them are as good as this is to their gluten orginalsThe kids and I absolutely love this stuff We throw in veggies hot dogs hamburger beans or just eat it plainWe have subscribed to this on Amazon because it is 19 cents per box cheaper than the local grocery storeand I dont have to drive there to get it
1,JellO SugarFree Instant Pudding is a great snack Since becoming a Type 2 diabetic last year I am always looking for good tasting low carb snacksThe JellO instant puddings are easy to make and taste so good that it is hard to tell it is a diet snackHighly recommended
1,Oh this was heaven at first bite  It is the exact cheese that Kraft uses in their little boxes of macaroni and cheese  I never liked the little noodles they used though  It is so delicious with regular Annas elbows  Just add a touch of vegetable oil a touch of milk and this powdered cheddar with a pinch of salt  I have since purchased a different brand of powdered cheddar and it is no match to this brand  I will buy this brand from now on
1,Sometimes I get a craving that only coconut water can satisfy  I prefer it plain and this stuff is very good  I prefer it really chilled and often put it in the freezer
1,This is my favorite sauce on Thai food Japanese food Korean food and Asian food I love this sauce on very dry rice and foods needing seasoning It is a little spicy but is sweet at the same time This sauce can be used to dip gyoza pot stickers egg rolls When I taste foods that is lacking flavor I dip it in this sauce
-1,I dont know if the Newmans had their friends come on here and write glowing reviews or something but Im amazed people are raving about this awful popcornThe problem is the palm oil I am never buying anything with palm oil again because of this popcorn it is disgusting Its not only solid at room temperature butwhen I heated one of the bags partially up to try to clean the oil off the kernels so I could pop them with some regular oil I couldnt even get the blasted stuffoff of the bowl I had it in with warm soap and waterSo I looked this frankenoil up its 85 percent saturated fat why the Newsmans Own company would choose this hard solidified oil instead of some regular oil is beyond me maybethe organic version of corn oil is too expensive maybe theyre trying to keep it from leaking during storage by having this solid mass I dont knowBut dont waste your money if you have any palate at all you wont like this the mouth feel is tacky and waxy plus an unpleasant taste to the palm oil which like others said solidifies onthe popcorn and gives this granularish greasy waxy feel Not good at all  If youre the type that cant tell the difference between margarine and butter or real whipped cream and cool whipyou might not mind this stuff But for something this saturated may as well use real butterIm stuck with about 8 more boxes Im having to heat and get the oil off the kernels what a blast
-1,Our glutenfree family of five has tried this several times and everyone seemed to lose their appetite when this was prepared  The cheese sauce comes in a packet that you squeeze on the noodles  Everyone agreed that the sauce is too cheesy thick and the flavor is not as good as other brandsstyles  Mac  Cheese is a staple in our house but we wont order this one again
-1,This is twice as expensive as basic box Mac and Cheese  It is just so so in taste  If you check the ingredients it is not much different than other Mac and Cheese  The cost does not justify the ordering  I will not be ordering from Amazon again  The cost is much cheaper at a big box chain
1,GURU Natural Energy Drink is a delicious tasting drink that will give you a super charge  The drink is lightly carbonated and has a sweet taste to it but unlike most energy drinks this one is not sticky sweet or overpowering  After I quaffed the GURU I started to slowly feel its effects  It was a slow burn that gradually worked its way  I enjoyed the extra energy boost and it really was the lift I needed o start the day  GURU comes in the perfect size of 84 ounces not too much but just enough and it wont go to wasteIf you are looking for a natural energy drink that not only will give you an energy surge and taste great then GURU Natural Energy Drink is your ticket
1,This tea is excellent with a little vanilla stevia Most effective if you take  bedtime let bag soak for 10 minutes to get the most out of derinking it
-1,I love tea  I was so excited to try this because of health benefits as well as the supposedly delicious taste  I bought the whole case with the intention of enjoying some myself and giving some as presents  The reviews were so positive and I thought the vanilla would have to make it wonderful no matter what  But I was wrong  To my taste this tea is awful  Its nearly tasteless which I do not consider a benefit in tea but what I did taste wasnt very nice  After one cup I threw away the box Id opened and put the unopened boxes where people could take them if they wanted  I wouldnt have given it to anyone as a gift
1,THIS IS WONDERFUL MAC AND CHEESE  I MAKE SO MANY TUNA CASSEROLES AND FIND THIS TO BE THE TASTIEST OF ITS KIND RECOMMENDED FOR MAC AND CHEESE LOVERS
-1,I bought this to make cookies with red color not wanting to use an unnatural red dye  The flavor was offputting and the color was not what I was looking for
-1,The texture was crumbly and dry The flavor tasted like a weak cup of espresso with no sweetener and a little cocoa powder I wasnt impressed and will not purchase these in the future The only redeeming quality is that they are somewhat good for you
1,Theese buckwheat noodles are so good and my nonhealth food loving husband actually prefers them over regular spaghetti He normally hates whole wheat spaghetti  Just use with regular tomato sauce you dont have to use them only for asianstyle dishes  Once again another great product by Annie  YumYum Annie Chun
1,this is by far my favorite loma linda product if you are missing meatloaf  and dont want to take the time to make a vegetarian substitute this product is amazing only 5 WW points for 2 patties i could eat this every day
-1,Im glad I bought the sampler instead of individual boxes because I didnt particularly like any of them  The flavor of each is pretty weak
1,I like my coffee creamy not to the point where it turns white but just enough to lighten the darkness so that the dark liquid starts to look like caramel in color Coffee mate is perfect because it does the job very effectively and it has a nice taste as well  This is a good option for the lactose intolerantThe subscribe and save option brings the price down to 535 which I think is probably the cheapest for a container this sizeThere are certain things that I feel should be considered for people drinking this stuffOne teaspoon has about 10 calories so if you are like me who puts a table spoon that is 30 calories I mentioned this because I drink 3 cups of coffee every day the calories can add up pretty fastCoffee mate also contains trans fats  one of the ingredients is Mono and diglycerides  these are agents used to extend the shelf life and we also see them in foods which have trans fats which have been bad It also contains hydrogenated fats which is linked to heart disease Incidentally the European version is sold without this ingredientEnjoy responsiblySource httpwwworganicauthoritycomhealthwhattheheckiscoffeematecreamerhtmlhttpwwwcspinetorg
-1,I have bought these numerous times over the years as a backup quick lunch at work if the need arises  Frankly it was my favorite flavor since I tended to vary the noodle flavors I bought over the years for variety  But this last order convinces me I wont be buying this flavor again  What once was a good Peanut Sesame Noodle is now a horrible Lemon Noodle with peanuts  They changed the recipe for the peanut sauce and its now just overpowering lemon grass I dont expect fine dining when I get these but I do expect edible and its nearly not
-1,Nice spicy tea  but I wanted a chocolate caramel tea Cant taste any chocolate and the bit of caramel flavor is drowned out by the strong spiciness I wont buy this flavor again
-1,With its newlook packaging Tazo also reformulated the Awake tea blend The old blend was strong robust and biting It was by far my favorite bagged black tea The new blend is weaker and maltier it is sadly reminiscent of standard Lipton tea If I want Lipton tea Ill buy Lipton tea its a lot cheaper than TazoI know that many people found the old blend to be too bitter Tazo apparently decided that theyd gain more customers than theyd lose if they toned down the flavor I dont know if theyre right but theyve definitely lost me
1,These are so GREAT for those times when you have a beer and nuts The perfect size and not a lot of calories Always have a box of these out for my quest who ask me where I get them and now we are putting them in our kids lunches They are lovin them and I know it is a healthy old fashion snack TRY them BET you cant eat just one 
-1,I am on the subscription service for the Slim Jim pack of 100  My most current order does not contain the same product  The box I received a few days ago has PORK in it which is NOT mentioned in the product description  But the ingredient of pork is clearly stated on the outside of the box along with beef and chicken  Also the sticks are soggy and limpno snap like the previous order  Im cancelling my subscribe  save option on this item
1,These are soooooooo good Light and cheesy all natural and best of allbaked not fried They fly out of our house
1,Husband enjoys baking gluten free foods with Authentic Foods Brown Rice Flour superfine Buying on line helps because I do not have to get out and drive on busy roads I buy from Amazoncom because I dont pay for shipping
1,special note  This is a review of the product not the offered priceI dont use a lot of molasses in my cooking but when I bake ginger snaps I love that the recipe I have calls for 14cup of molasses  Why  Because molasses have a lot of iron  4 of the daily requirement per 1 tablespoon of Grandmas  Not a fantastic amount per cookie but every little bit helps with toddlers and growing big kidsThat said you can imagine my surprise when my husband brought home another brand Golding Farms where the iron percentage is double 2X GrandmasSomething to considerPam Teemomfoodiepsthis is the 2nd best molasses advice I ever got first is dont use sulpured  Use a spray oil on measuring cups  That way the molasses just slips out and you get all the goodness
1,very good bbq sauce
-1,I thought I would try to cut a few points out of my day by using this chocolate dip to help my cravingsIt tasted okay It was okay with fruit but the fruit was way sweeter than the chocolate  It almost tasted like a very bitter chocolate  I think if I didnt eat any chocolate for a couple months then ate this I would like it but thats not the case It will probably sit in my fridge until it expires
-1,First let me just sayI thought about this before I wrote this review after taking things into consideration I decided since my satisfaction was a total disregard in the first place I think I should warn people prior to their purchasewhen I received my package EVERYTHING in the box was dripping in honey  might I add NOT CHEAP honey at that I bought 2 jars of this honey  they were both destroyed when they came The boxes of Tea I purchased were also in the box with the jars  were sloshing in the broken glass jars of honey as wellWhy buy glass jars of anything if it comes busted I have purchased many items on Amazon that were glass  always they were wrapped specially for protection against the rough treatments in transit This time however  it was rolling around loose DUH you do NOT insert 2 glass jars together in a big box  expect them to arrive in tact I mean how dumb it was so gross I couldnt salvage anything but the honey soaked tea boxes Needless to say I wont be buying from this company again I know who I can safely buy fromthose sellers that take extra care in the shipping process OUT 4557  one BIG FAT STICKY MESS
-1,I love coconut water To be more specific I love GOOD coconut water My preferred brand after trying just about every one on the market is the Taste Nirvana which is smooth only slightly sweet and very refreshing The Taste Nirvana Lite with pulp is a bout 50 sweeter than the regular and is very good as well with the pulp being crisp and fresh Goya runs a close second I am not sure if its the tetra packs or just the coconut water itself that makes Zico taste a little sour to me Coconut water should not taste sour Despite the rave reviews I think the Zico water is just not as good as the Nirvana or Goya Sorry I bought a whole case without trying it first
1,These are like the butter candies but with coffee They are pretty addictive though not severely unhealthy and great to give out to coworkers I even substituted coffee with these candies at one point They also go very well with coffee
1,I cook a batch of beans every week  Often vegetarian or just a touch of bacon or ham hock for flavor  A spoonful of liquid smoke and some molasses always guarantees a delicious dishI roasted a supermarket chicken  Not too much flavor in those  I mixed together 1 teaspoon each of smoke molasses or brown sugar and black bean sauce  Rubbed the chicken sprinkled with pepper YumBBQ glaze  In a small bowl according to your personal taste mix catsup brown sugar soy sauce molasses mustard a few drops of smoke maybe some hot sauce  Mix thoroughly Brush on meat toward the end of grillingMarinate meat in some soy sauce brown sugar and liquid smoke  Dip onion halves in the marinade and grillMixed a few drops into some vegetable oil brushed on potatoes and roasted them yumits great stuff
-1,I gave this a few tries and ended up binning the rest  I am not a Mac and Cheese person I did try to roll my own with some pasta also tried with instant mashed potatoes Worth a try in either case
1,But for the money Ill continue to buy my usual stock from Sams club  I couldnt tell any difference and the generic nuts from Sams are much less expensive
-1,Ok I agree that coconut water can be an acquired taste  However if one chills the coconut water and adds FRESH I repeat FRESH lime juice to it the taste is fantasticI consider this essential to natural hydration without chemicals colors etcUpdateONE is definitely better tasting we switched
-1,My kids eat the boxed Kraft Mac and cheese so I thought these were a great idea YUCK I bought a whole case and had to get rid of them No one would eat themthey taste different than the boxed variety They have a strong fake cheesy chemical flavor and odormaybe from the plastic the product is microwaved in BLECH
1,The price point on this on Amazon is insane check out just about anywhere else online Walmart and you will pay at least half of what they are selling it for hereOkay on to the base itself Just confirming the excellent experience I have had with this stock Up until recently  I totally agreed with several other reviewers  the only way to get better stock was to make it from scratch It is not loaded up with salt as noted by other reviews and I thought I had found the best chicken and beef base for a long time to come Then I switched to Minors Gluten Free Base because I needed to be sure I was gluten free Wow it is even better than the Better Than Boullion I  have used four other brands next to this one the Minors is the 5th brand  and this is definitely the best better tasting no problems with salt I love it can easily add a dab to any dish that needs a flavor kick and I know I am gluten free Even if I wasnt I would still buy the Minors because it tastes the best
1,This was pretty good and shipped rather quickly  I will have to order more of this for my grandchildren to have their own packages They loved it as well
1,OMG I cant believe the variety of these Sides that Lipton has to offer After devouring the tasty Stroganoff Side I just had to try another sticktoyourribs meal so I went for this Rice MedleyAt the risk of sounding like a glutton Im going to confess I made those little impolite moaning sounds while eating this dish  but who wouldnt The flavor of this yummy rice dish is enhanced by vermicelli dried peas carrots and onions in chickenflavored sauce  Mmmmmm  Oops there I go again Well at least Im not burping  lolOhhhh I see other tempting varieties Asian Sides Fiesta Sides and more and all just as easy to prepare as the Stroganoff see previous reviewExcuse me Im off to the kitchen again These are so easy so delicious I may never cook againReviewed by Betty Dravis 2008author of Millennium Babe The Prophecy
-1,Not familiar with what chai tea is supposed to taste like but this tea tasted like stewed cloves to me  YuckGot this flavor in a sampler box and so far its the only Stash tea Ive tried and disliked strongly Some are better than others of course but I find this particular flavor really really unpleasant which is odd given my love for most of the spices listed on label  The problem is that the clove just overwhelms everything and thats about all I could taste outside a touch of cinnamon IMO clove has much too strong a taste to be used beyond sparinglyin anything Perhaps adding milk and sugar mightve made it more palatable  might even be the way its supposed to be prepared but one of the reasons I drink tea is to stay away from having to add sweeteners or milk to make it taste good In any case I cant imagine using enough milksweetener to subdue the overwhelming clove taste would leave any room in the mug for tea or water
1,I have nothing but praise for these Planters NutsAs usual they are fresh and perfectly packaged for cooking  baking  or just eatingI usually get a larger sized portioned bagbut you know this smaller sized one worked great My husband took several out for eating to work and the smaller size just made everything handierIt would be nice I guess to find one thing to complain aboutbut with Planters Nuts I just havent been able to find anything wrong I love em
-1,The taste of this stuff is sooooo unnatural I dont know who said this would taste like hickory smoke it went to the garbage within a minute Not good 
1,I have to be honest after reading the other reviews I was expecting way more flavor in this tea I was also expecting a thicker texture which it doesnt haveThough I really like chai tea I havent had it in maybe 15 years and couldnt remember much of the taste anymore However its still a great tasting tea Even nontea drinkers will like the light smooth vanilla taste of this dessert flavorlike tea I decided to get it in decaf because I will be drinking it a few times a day Great alternative to pop and other similar drinks I suggest giving it a try
-1,I prefer the Cheetos brand These do not have as much tangy cheese flavor as Cheetos and dont have as much of the good corn meal taste and texture I have 11 12 bags left and went to the local store to buy more Cheetos
1,Green tea can be very bitter especially if you brew it too long This tea brews quickly and has a very pure taste and delicate aroma I like drinking each cup with a packet of stevia It seems to sweeten it just enough without masking the subtle silky flavors This tea is made of rare white tea and green tea White tea actually has more antioxidants than green tea and has less caffeine So this particluar tea is very healthy However you will probably drink it often because it tastes so goodThe Rebecca Review
1,Im soon to be a mother of 3 and my two younger children both enjoyed Enfamil Formulas Enfamil AR Baby Formula MilkBased with Iron is a special formula for colicspit up from Enfamil  Enfamil AR is a milk based formula  for babies ages 012months Its extremely versatile and mixes well with cereal and oatmeal like all EnfamilEnfagrow formulasLike All Enfamil formulas It has extra DHA and Iron vitamins and helps support better growth brain  eye development as well as immune system development So your baby wont be losing out on any of the great essential vitamins and minerals needed for healthy developmentEnfamil AR Baby Formula MilkBased with Iron Combo Pack comes with 1 full 222 oz tub of formula as well as 3 boxes of 166 oz two pack refills which easily slip into the tub once empty  This saves you so much money because buying the tub or cans by themselves can range from 2528 dollars each  I would definitely recommend this formula combo pack to anyone with a special little baby
1,My favorite decaf green tea not too strong not too weak  It has a great flavor  I sometimes mix it with fresh ginger an orange peel and 34Davidsons mulling spice34
1,Great taste when sweetenedFull of antioxidants and vitamin C I believeI add it with ginger to make a pot of black tea and chill the tea when it has cooled in used soda bottlesThen I dilute it with a little ginger ale to tasteExcellent
1,Pizza is a staple for us and this has become essential The ground up bits of dried tomato add depth beyond the usual italian spice mix though Frontiers other italian spice mix generally gets a shake or two as wellWell worth the small premium over the usual italian spice mixes
-1,By far this is the weirdeststinkiest organic product I have ever encountered In a nutshell this lotion smells like baby puke I mean baby food thrown up all over so gross  It didnt hit me in the store but when I got back to work and slathered it all over I wasnt so sure that the smile on my face wanted to remain there My friend bought it too I smelled her on her skin and in the tube and same thing yuckThe moisturizing properties are meek at their best This is not really for mature skin I had to reapply repeatedly and it felt my hands feeling clammy and stinking of baby food and Im only twenty six I adore this line for all their other products the shampoos are amazing and the scrub works well but this one item is not the best to sample I would suggest testing it in the store to see if one can handle it before shelling out some bucks on it I rarely encounter beauty products that are this bad and this one cuts the cheese err I mean takes the cake in this case Kasia S
-1,OK I admit I have a serious anaphylactic milk allergy But after reading the reviews here I thought this product sounded so magically wonderful that Id give it a try anywayBig mistakeIm out of the hospital now and back at my computer so that parts good And I did get a helicopter ride to a major medical center even if I wasnt awake for itStill all things considered this product was a lousy purchase The FDA needs to put a stop to the moneygrubbing corporate monsters who market this stuff Save your money and save your life
1,These are excellent organic moist reliably good  I order them often and keep them in my kitchen for cooking and snacks
-1,I love blueberries green tea and Yogi Teas but I do not like this  It has an orange spice taste up front like the only flavored tea around when I was a kid didnt like it then dont like it now  Then it finishes with a Stevia after taste  Yuck  I like my teas plain and would prefer to add my own sweetener if I feel its needed  This is a miss in my book and its not surprising when the ingredients list natural orange flavor before natural blueberry flavor in the line up  Why not something more natural like actual blueberry Right Silly me It doesnt taste like a berry of any kind by my standards So if berry and green tea are the taste youre looking for AND you like the multifaceted herbal taste of Yogi brand teas then try their Goji Berry instead its wonderful w no weird sweetener after taste and no orange spice Goji Berry is 5 stars in my book
-1,The macaroni is straight not 34elbowed34 like the picture on the box  Prepared according to instructions this is not 34mothers34  I will buy some 34elbow34 macaroni and 34cheese34 it up with either Velveta or Cheese Whiz  Or without naming names buy the 34real34 stuff from the grocery store freezer
-1,I wont take up too much of your time This is the singular worst tasting Shells and Cheese Mac and Cheese product Ive ever had The cheese has the most bitter aftertaste and is so unappealing even my cats would not eat it I rarely if ever review food products but this one is so bad that I felt I must just to do my public dutySo for our house its 6 thumbs and 8 paws down Awful
1,This flour adds a nice flavor and a bit more texture to baked goods  It makes for a better bars brownies crusts and cookiesVery nice quality and I will reorder
-1,For the Holidays last year I decided to forgo the legitimate Pumpkin Pie and try something a bit lighterhealthier Im familiar with JellOs No Bake line such as their delicious No Bake cheesecake so I figured their Pumpkin Pie style mix should be good too Well its not At first taste I thought thats not bad but after a few mouthfuls of it I could barely stand it anymore There are two main problems I find with it First of all the consistency is off it doesnt really get to a Pie consistency more like pudding as another reviewer mentioned Ive added less milk 15 cups and that helped a bit with the texture now more like thicker pudding Second in order to compensate for the lack of any real Pumpkin Kraft put wayy too much ginger cinnamon nutmeg or whatever else in there The pumpkin spice flavor is overly pronounced and upsets my stomach after a few spoonfuls So now Im stuck with a few boxes of this stuff trying to figure out how to use it andor get rid of it  At the very least I could use the included crust mixes for another one of JellOs better flavors
-1,I love all kinds of teas I drink some every day  I saw that so many people like this blueberry variety so I decided to try it  I am a big believer in the groupthink of customer reviews  And I am rarely disappointed in anything Amazon  I didnt see that stevia is an ingredient  Stevia creates a very bitter taste in my mouth  So I will be sharing this shipment with my friends who dont mind stevia  Im going to look at other Yogi teas and check on the ingredients closely
1,That the color of the egg product suffers a bit from being driedI have uploaded some Product Images to illustrateThe images show 3 bowlsOne with Honeyville Farms powder HVOne with straight dry yolk powder from another vendor Y andOne with a fresh large egg FRESHThe images pretty fairly represent the color issue  the dry and mixed powders both are duller and browner than the fresh eggThe mixed powders were blended with bottled water as per the label directions and allowed to stand for several minutes to fully hydrateA third image shows a batch of scrambled eggs made from the illustrated egg products with additional seasoning dairy spices and garnish The eggs tasted fine and looked OK when lightened with dairy and camouflaged with chives paprika and butterWhat wouldntSo if you are using the egg powder in dishes where the color is not particularly important this product should be fine But if you are depending on the bright cheery yellow of a fresh egg yolk as in scrambled eggs or an omelet you should probably stick to fresh Or use camouflage like Honeyville did on their package picture
-1,Yesterday I wrote to this Seller stzting that I got 4 of these barrels of cheese balls and each one had an expiration date of 107  seems like they went through their inventory and sent out everything that was old  have not heard back from them so thats why I am writing this  We give a lot of these out to the kids in the neighborhood as presents  Today we got another 4 from a Seller  these 4 barrels had an expiration date of 22512The need to realize that taking old inventory just to get rid of it during the holiday rush doesnt really work  its going to be a long time before I order anything from them again
1,This product is great for those meals when you have no time or patience for a larger meal plan and it is so handy for any camping or trips where vegetarian food may be scarce  It can be added to any rice or noodle dish or eaten plain with vegetables  The taste is pleasing
1,I settled on caffeine free teaBlack Cherry and Blueberry are my second and third choices compared to Cinnamon Apple Spice
1,I love this tea I have Menieres which means caffeine is very restricted Im not a real fan of tea but tried this flavor out when it was on sale and love it Its naturally sweet has 0 calories 0 fat  0 sugar Yes the flavor of cinnamon is dominant and the apple spice flavor tastes like a delicious apple This in one of those teas where you wrap your hands around the mug to warm up and savor the smell  taste Ive heard that cinnamon is good for your health  cinnamon is the first ingredient listed on the package Great price Packaged well and was here in two day w Amazon prime
1,Not delicious but its pretty good and fulfilling Its a good choice for road trips Its nice for those of us that eat organic and gluten free which makes it hard to find something to eat on the road these fill the need Peanut Butter is my fav or the Envirokidz crispy rice bars
1,What can I say about peppermint tea  It hits the spot whether hot or iced my favorite  I also like like combining this with green tea or red vanilla tea  This tea has a nice fresh flavor and the product is made even better by being organicso important when you are consuming something such as a leaf with a large surface area where contaminants reside  Price on this product is good too
1,I never thought I would subscribe to a snack mix but I like these so much that I now have some on hand all the time thanks to Amazons discounted subscription rate  I feel silly recommending chex mix but Im sure there are some others out there besides me who are looking for a sweet and salty healthierthanusual snack  So here goesThis mix has a great combination of chex cereal pretzels and these sweet swirly cookies  The pretzels are fine the sweetened cereal pieces are very good and those swirlsgoodness those swirls  I open a bag and immediately start hunting down those swirls  They are so good that I wish I could get bags of just the swirlsAnd Amazon could you please start including nutritional information with the foods you sell  Maybe even a scan of the nutritional label  For those who care here are some key figures 12 cup serving 8 per bag  35g fat no cholesterol 21g carbohydrates 1g fiber 4g sugar 2g protein
-1,I had to throw this out because it really didnt taste good Its hard to describe the taste but it didnt taste like anything that Ive had in Japanese restaurants
1,This Womans Dong Quai Tonic from Yogi Tea is for hormone balance Im pretty finicky with my tea tastes and I like it It has an herby and slightly spicy slightly sweet taste to it that makes it a pleasure to drink I usually brew two bags in one cup which is recommended on the package for overall health and fatigue relief It is stronger that way and more intense of an experience although it still tastes great with just one bag Id been having lots of hot flashes and wanted to get down to business with this teaWomans Dong Quai Tonic comes with an expiration date a good thing because its not full of preservatives plus you can tell if it is fresh and is organicThe ingredients in Womans Dong Quai Tonic are dong quai root extract juniper berry extract and a proprietary blend of herbs including all organic cinnamon bark orange peel ginger root fennel seed chamomile flower dandelion root anise seed stinging nettle leaf dong quai root I guess as opposed to the extract black pepper and orange oil Amazingly I can taste some of these like the chamomile and the anise seed and the ginger making for a lovely and complex cup of tea Im impressedYogi Tea seems to be another company like Numi Aspen Traditional Medicinals that values sustainable and healthy practices Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed with info about each tea they makeYogi Tea writes this on the box about the teas benefits Organic Womans Dong Quai Tonic is an effective and organic way to lessen fatigue restore your energy and balance a womans hormones This healing tonic is formulated to ease what traditional Chinese medicine practitioners refer to as blood deficiency resulting from stress poor digestion or improper eating and health habits Weve included in our tonic the potent Queen of Herbs Dong Quai Angelica sinensis shown to be effective in supporting the reproductive organs addressing common female hormone imbalances helping to regulate the menstrual cycle and building allaround health Bartrams Encyclopedia of Herbal Medicine 1995 indicates Dong Quai is useful for a wide range of female conditions including minor symptoms of PMS such as mild mood changes and menopause such as hot flashes This powerful herb is complemented by Organic Nettle to help detox your body as well as Organic Dandelion Root and Juniper Berry to help maintain proper water balance According to yogic wisdom women have greater emotional awareness and intuitive powers A woman can choose to be balanced happy and healthy Choose to drink a daily cup of Womans Dong Quai Tonic and feel like your healthy beautiful graceful self I dont know about that but I do like the tea and it seems like it might be helping with my hot flashes Ive been having fewerwhether or not its due to the tea I dont know which is why I bought itfor menopausal supportThere are no cautions or warnings on the box except the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose treat cure or prevent any diseaseHighly recommended
-1,I ordered these on May 21 and they turned out old with a bad aftertaste however I order another batch around mid June and they taste totally fresh and greatI would really appreciate a refund on the order that tasted old and had an aftertaste or be offered a fresh batch of the product such would dictate good customer serviceUpdateIve contacted Amazon on the specific order of this item that tasted old and had an aftertaste Ive been reimbursed for that specific order right away Thats the Amazon customer service Ive grown used to excellent and will keep me returning as a loyal customerThank you Amazon
-1,Vanilla taste is just not in the product leaves a scum in the cup not what I expected at all back to Loranns Vanilla liquidMaybe I can palm the other two bottles to an unsuspecting gullible guy like me
1,My only complaint is the cost of this seasoning online I only bought it to see if this is the one I wanted Some time ago I bought these large bottle of the Table blend by mistake which turned out to be mostly pepper and was very disappointed The Original blend is the one that has the best flavors NOT the Table BlendThe service is very good however so would shop here again
1,I like kikkoman soy sauce and this is a good value  It gives a good flavor to everything I use it in
-1,I bought this for my daughter who complain that it was really grainy and gritty  I wont be buying it again  It isnt available at the local health food store
-1,First the potato strands are too easy to burn After the initial cooking you press the mixture down to brown the bottom You turn them which is interesting because they stick Then you brown the other side Now it is time to stir in the Velveeta cheese sauceWhat is the point of browning both sides of the mixture when the potatoes probably burned when you startedEven Velveeta couldn8217t save this productThe dollar stores had a lot of this product Want to guess why
1,I didnt know what to expect when I ordered this jar of pommery Mustard and was surprised when I tried it to see the consistency of the spread  It looks like a mustard that hasnt been ground up completely  Okay if I had read up about it I probably would have known that the name tells it all  There are always consequences for your actions sometime good and sometimes bad  This time I was lucky this mustard is great on a sandwich  I love the stone jar
-1,unsure if I just got a bad batch or whatthe flavor has been bland and never builds to the expected pop of wasabifollowed the directions exactly but just didnt get the results I was hoping for
-1,I didnt like this beef jerky much especially the texture I do like the more natural ingredients however
1,One a day is the only way  These bars are super  Crunchy and great dark chips plus a real pick me up in the morning  A real adult treat any time
1,I really like these cookies When the cookies arrived the sides of the cookies were crumbled off but they still tasted great I will buy these again They dont taste like glutenfree You can taste the butter and the pecans in the cookies
-1,if you have misgivings about magnesium stearate dont buy this product its a white powder packed with the tea bags that you need to do your research on before you decide about it i have decided against it after reading various diverse views
-1,I like coconut water but this flavor was awful  I was really disappointed  It was cloying on the palette  We will not be purchasing this again
-1,I live in a remote area where I cannot get these great products I ordered two different kinds of this cereal and all 6 bags of the oat bran flakes smelled very rancid when the bags were opened It is not returnable as I later found out Warning buy cereal close to home not online it was an expensive lesson The chickens will eat well this week
1,This soup has a good flavor and the broth is nice  It could use more substance or at least more vegetables  The chicken is an adequate amount but I cant stress enoughI felt like some of the vegetables were lacking  I found myself adding some to it  I would eat it again but there are other soups out there that are more satisfying  and more meat and vegetables added
1,This is our favorite pancake mixI use it for all of us gluten free or notI make up extra pancakes and then reheat foranother day I will also make up breakfastsandwichespancake egg bacon or sausagethen top it off with another pancake Betterthan McDs It also makes great wafflesThey are nice and moist I have used thismix for awhile nowand recommend it 5 stars
-1,At our house we usually make our own mac n cheese with real cheese but sometimes it would be nice to whip this dish up super quick from a box However after receiving this we feel the extra time and effort is worth it Even our 3 year old son said he didnt want this again Yes he has been spoiled on the real thing but I think in this instance thats a good thing We have tried the Betty Crocker brand of mac n cheese since ordering this and we do feel the Betty Crocker is a little better
-1,I noticed Jessica Alba promoting ZICO while taking credit as a well behaved caring parent who had many health issues when she was a child and now how proud she is being part of these fine companies including ZICO meaning she shares the profit of the sales Lets look at some facts on ZICO1 INGREDIENT all natural coconut water Ask yourself have you ever seen a natural food item any food item even a coconut water when you crack a fresh coconut where the natural water of that coconut to last for months in any temperature No it will not last more than few hours so why is it that Jessica is not disclosing the preservatives that are included inside ZICO cartons and bottles when infact you will get no preservatives when cracking a fresh coconut and drinking the coconut juice for a dollar a coconut instead of four dollars for ZICO With fresh coconut you will even end up with fresh coconut meat as well2 HYDRATE hydration requires consuming water at zero calories not sugar You can drink all the coconut juices in the world and it still will not hydrate unless you drink water Sugar will force you to drink water so you will have to consume water after drinking ZICO3 HAND HARVEST COCONUTS FROM AROUND THE WORLD meaning not a Fair Trade certified product Meaning ZICO is the same as Coco Cola the same as the competition without Fair Trade certification4 AS MUCH POTASSIUM AS A SMALL BANANA Let compare based on NUTRITION FACTS For a cup comparison although not the same since we are comparing liquid with solid but regardless ZICO vs banana in calories 5033 potassium 360317 sugar 1024 and tall of that not considering where banana offers 37mg of Phytosterols in lowering cholesterol all other vitamins and minerals from 171 vitamin C A K B6 fiber and all minerals where ZICO offers none other than sugar in a processed containerIt is fine to consume a processed food or drink if one wishes to do so but for Jessica Alba is purely misleading public while acting as a caring individual ZICO is a processed drink in a carton which has a whopping 40gr of sugar processed just like other coconut water brands like CocaCola not a Fair Trade product which has nothing to do with hydration or banana I drink coconut water by cracking cold coconuts that I keep in my refrigerator and understand the nutritional value of each when a fresh coconut costs me a dollar a banana twenty five cents not four dollars for a processed coconut in container with preservative
-1,This decaf really disappointed me esp given the other glowing reviews  It does not appear green nor does it taste green ie doesnt have that fresh grassy flavor many describe as found in an authentic Japanese green tea  Actually this could be a good paring with seafood because  I sometimes detect a slight fishiness in the taste  Yuk  Stash Decaf Green the nonorganic nonpremium tea is actually a little better than this one  What people like is a matter of personal taste but I wont ever buy this tea again
1,It is a little expensive for the amount yet I have nothing to compare it to I have ordered it twice and will order it again The first time I ordered Guar Gum with it I attempted to add it to the yogurt powder in the blender and it did not turn out well for me However I love the taste when added to my oatmeal and fruit smoothies in the morning
1,I love this salt and use it on my french fries as well as on popcorn  It is not as good as fleur de sel or some of the other gourmet salts but it is only 15 cents per ounce not 15 dollars  Note that this salt is flaked unlike the normal crystals for which Diamond Salt is known  It absolutely CLINGS to the surface of the popcorn fries and other similarlytextured foods MUCH better  It has a cleaner taste than some of the brown or grey sea salts and CLEAN is always good in my bookAs a treat I sometimes Iick the tip of my index finger sprinkle a little of this on it and then pretend like Im getting ready to do a mini tequilla shooter but without the lime  Almost like a couple of hours on the beachI can only give it four stars instead of five because it is NOT IODIZED and you could end  up looking just like a frog with big goiter things on your neck if you dont get enough iodine  This is not a problem for people who eat a lot of seafood but if you live in the Midwest far from the ocean it could cause some difficulties
-1,If you are interested in using this as a dietary supplement you should buy in bulk You would have to take more than half the bottle at one time just to receive the daily dietary benefits This is 10 times more expensive than buying in bulk and either taking with a spoon or adding it to your food I am fond of NOWs products but this is just a response to a uneducated consumer demand SO GET EDUCATED It is your health Find a much better online bulk price and buy it by the gallon or better and you will be feeling and looking better
1,This is the first time I tried Annies products and it was not bad  I found the flavor a little weak even though I added a little butter with the milk  I found when I added some of my own Italian seasoning and crushed red pepper the flavor perked right up  The box says 25 servings but I think its really 2
-1,I would give this really a 15 star but I was generous It is way too sweet Others have said the same in their reviews but I ignored them to my chagrin It is very very thin and has a texture and appearance like it has been reconstituted and highly processed Because it is so thin there are never any big lumps of gristle but sometimes you can tell the meat quality as a bit off in some pieces The worst problem is the overly sweet flavor the second problem is the texture and meat quality This is not a very good jerky Their Buffalo while also too sweet is much better as is their Turkey They are much much less expensive than a really premium jerky like those from Mountain America so it is a toss up For the price I may reorder the Turkey and perhaps Buffalo but I will never order this Beef again
-1,IZZE Fortified Sparkling Juice Blackberry 84Ounce Cans Pack of 24Nice flavor but I found it so sweet its undrinkable I have been drinking Izzy carbonated juice drinks and find that level of sweetness just about right Each of the tiny cans of Essn Meyer Lemon juice has the equivalent of about 11 teaspoons of sugar in it and about 170 calories Being that the cans are only 84 ounces thats quite a lot If you want something refreshing avoid this But if you like syrupy sweet drinks youll like this The lemon flavor is nice but they should cut the sugar in half if not by 23
-1,I used to really like this snack but this shipment just seemed very stale and tasteless I cant remember why I liked them
1,So many flavors I cant begin to tell you how much I love all of mae ploy curries I should ask them for recipes Basically its a plastic lidded container about the size of I wanna say two and one half yogurts It has a bag inside that you pull out and inside that clear bag is the curry Its all mashed in there I cut a corner and take out  a little at a time Having the spices mixed and its a paste makes it nicer to make a sauce and marry this flavor to anything Veggies love it that are steamed scrambled eggs rice pasta and even fish and meat
-1,IF YOURE SOY SENSITIVE LIKE ME BE AWARE THAT THIS AND OTHER HIBISCUS TEAS BY CELESTIAL SEASONINGS HAVE SOY LECITHIN IT MAY NOT BE LISTED ON THE WEB BUT WHEN YOU GET IT IN THE MAIL AND READ THE INGREDIENTS ON THE BOX THERE IT IS SOY LECITHIN SOY LECITHIN DOESNT MAKE ME ITCH AS MUCH AS SOYBEAN OIL OR SOY PROTEIN BUT IF I WANT TO GET AN ITCH FREE GOOD NIGHTS SLEEP I STAY CLEAR OF IT
1,Yes I would buy it again but I wish it had a little more vanilla in itI received in two days
-1,I agree with the last reviewer the ingredients list on amazon should be more clear I thought this was a vegetarian soup when I ordered it  now after receiving the package I am disappointed to discover that powdered bonito is powdered fish It clearly states that Bonito is fish on the package but on amazon it doesnt specify this  So this purchase ended up being nothing more than 10 bucks down the drain for meI have a shellfish allergy that developed a few years ago I have had to be very careful about all seafood as I have had reactions to some fish paste and soups made with fish sauce at restaurants Fish  shellfish are not the same as far as allergies so I do not know why this sometimes happens It could have been crosscontamination or maybe I am allergic to certain fish as wellIn any case I make it a point to avoid things like powdered fish in my food
1,I thought these were pretty tasty however at 4box I still think they need to do a bit of work on the pricing of this product This said they do taste pretty good While the cheese sauce and noodles arent quite up to par with a Velveeta Shells and Cheese type product they werent terrible either The nice thing that I really like is these make for a nice cheap and easy way of making a side I bought the ones that are reminiscent of Kraft blue box mac and cheese and am hoping theyre better as theyre a bit cheaperKind of going back to the price issue brought up before  my local grocery store sells Kraft and Velveeta shells and cheese for a little over 2 This makes this product nearly DOUBLE the price of normal shells and cheese I find that horrible Its no different in any store Ive seen either
1,I bought this product to keep my dog free from parasites fleas ticks etcIt seems to work quite well since he has not had any buggies on him all summer  Last month after a walk in the woods I came back and a tick fell on my lap it did not stay on my boy that is what I want  I live in the woods and bugs are a problem or should I say they were a problemGiving this is not hard my dog loves them I do not have to crush them to give them I just have to shake the container and wherever he is he comes runningBecause of this product I no longer need to use those awful drops you must put on their backs to repel bugs this is a safer better way to keep your pets bug freeUPDATEIf your pet has any yeast infections going on stay away from this product  Some claim it helps with yeast but as I found out just recently yeast is yeast and all yeast may cause yeast infections in sensitive dogs  Like mine  I can no longer use this product they claim on the label it hels with skin problems and since yeast causes skin problems I assumed this would hlep It does not it makes it worse
-1,We are a Kraft dinner eating family for decades and nearly every week we cook at least 4 boxes This looked like a great idea for lunches at work It does not taste like normal Kraft Dinner nor do the noodles cook enough when following the directions I will not buy this again
-1,These are tasteless and No Ginger Will not buy again Do not recommend Try grandmas old fashion instead I dont care for them at all
1,Arrived in excellent  conditionfresh and always tasty Good value Always a favorite and excellent for snackingsinfully tasty and addictiveHighly recommended
1,For the amount of green tea you get for the low price this is a great deal Its not especially good or pure green tea but its mellow and helps me stay alert through the day A good buy overall
1,We dont drink buttermilk but love it for cooking such as buttermilk pancakes sour dough breads and anything else I can think of to put it in
-1,I just purchased a box of these to only discover that the new improved formula is awfulThe crisps are not puffed at all and are completely flat and hard not at all like how they use to be or what is pictured on the bag They are like chewing on flat rocks to be honest with youI wrote the company asking if these was a bad batch or something to only get a response that this is the new formula and We think the new product has an improved mouth feel and overall pleasing crunch experience which we believe will ultimately provide for a better snacking experiencePlain and simple I am NOT going to be buying these again Look elsewhere Glenny for soy chipscrisps
-1,Ive never had miso soup but I highly doubt this is what its suppose to taste like It tastes like hot toilet water Seriously Its bland no flavor at all not even salty just totally unsatisfying I liked the noodles though but not even noodles can save this soup I even added less water like reviews suggested and it didnt help at all Ive also tried Annies Udon soup and its gross as well I wont be trying anymore of Annies soups they seem to all have a similar flavor that is just bland and disgusting
-1,If you want a real ginger chew buy Gin Gins  These have 34hint o ginger34 at best  I think they waved the ginger over the box before shipping to call them ginger chews  I guess I got spoiled on Gin Gins  They dont taste nasty or anything just like sugar taffy  Glad I got the small package to try them  I had my husband take them to work to try and get rid of them on the unsuspecting people there
1,I think as far as not too bad for you convenient food goes this is actually yummy It has a tangy bit plenty of noodles and is easy to prepare I cant say its adequate on the veggie side but its no reason not to eat it again and again 
1,As per the reviews I bought one bag of the Cappuccino  Im pretty demanding when it comes to taste especially with coffee  These have great taste rich and robust without being overly sweet or aggressive  A new addition to my must haves
1,These are absolutely the best shortbread cookies I have had gluten free or otherwise I feel they are better than Keeblers Pecan Sandies  With only 9 cookies per box they are pricier but they are a good size and rich so you are satisfied with less  I appreciate Amazon offering them for such a fair price
1,I like these noodles They cook quickly The buckwheat gives them a little more flavor than common spaghetti noodles For a simple onedish meal serve some stirfried meat and vegetables on top of a bed of soba noodlesJust be careful of the price Similar quality soba noodles cost less than 2 per pound at local grocery stores Amazons price is sometimes better but usually not
1,I love many of the Celestial Seasons teas but this is one of my favorites I combine it one on one with their Raspberry Green Tea and get the antioxidents I desire from the Green Tea while still betting that punch of raspberry flavor that I love
-1,I love sugar and chocolate but these bars are too sweet  I bought them based on the reviews but I gave them away since they are too sugary  They could get away with using a third less sugar and still be sweet  I was looking forward to a healthy bar but these arent the ones for me  Bummer
-1,Theres a lot of talk about echinacea being a lot of hooey when it comes to helping cure or reduce a cold and its probably true except this tea contains a lot of organic kombucha spearmint leaf lemongrass as well as green tea  in addition to echinacea with a nice tangerine tang to it so you really feel youre getting relief for your cold with this tea You dont have to rely upon the mythical effects of echinacea to receive benefits from this tea and enjoy itAnd it is enjoyable to sip and its sumptuous when raw unfiltered honey is added to itIt smells and tastes good and it warms the throat like a good brandy I really do feel that it supports the immune systemThe only problem I have with this tea is the Yogi tea company that provides the product It thinks extortion is somehow proper so it colludes with the kosher mafia to put a damn 34U34 with a circle around it as a symbol on the box an icon the cost for which is passed off onto the unsuspecting consumer in order to support an organization of rabbis who also do not provide a health service to the individual consumer Thats really a raw deal for us This costly symbol conveys no help benefits and simply comprises an involuntary kosher taxNonJewish Americans need no rabbis ratings  This company needs to find a better way Maybe put a 34W34 for White people or a 34C34 for Christians And an 34M34 for Muslims And get other races and other religions to pay for the symbol Until then only  a boycott will fix the problemCheck out double you double you double you dot checkthelabel dot com dot uk
-1,I love tea and wanted to give loose leaf a try However loose leaf tea can be pretty expensive and Im picky with tea Not a connoisseur at all just flat out picky This pack seemed perfect It was cheap and I would be able to have a variety of teas I received black tins that includedLung Ching dragon well greenPuerhJasmineLychee BlackTikuanyin oolong varietyOolongSo far Ive only tried the Tikuanyin but its decent Again as Im new to loose leaf I might not be the best judge but I find the flavor pleasing There are stems in all of the tins and some of them are quite big To their credit the tins are filled to the brim with tea In the end I think you really get what you pay for The tea is nice enough but not as high brow as typical loose leaf teasUpdateTaken down to two stars The more tea I try the less I like it Im probably going to end up throwing all of these out Youre better off buying bagged tea its a higher qualityLychee had a highly metallic taste to it Took two sips and threw the rest outLung Ching was bland and had a dull flavor Not at all bright and clean as tea normally is Seemed maybe it was old and stored poorlyPuerh was alright nothing special Im new to Puerh tea so I may not be the best judge on this one I enjoy Foojay Dim Sum Puerh quite a bit This was like a toned down versionI found the more of this I drank the more stems I was picking out Seemed to be almost half stems
1,These taste great and when I got them very few were broken on average one pretzel per bag was broken  They are shorter than most pretzel rods about 4 inches each  I was making chocolatedipped pretzels and was trying to figure out how many I could put in each gift bag so I had my kids count how many there were per Newmans Own 8Ounce bag  There are about 40 pretzels per bag  I ordered two cases trying to make sure I had enough so hopefully this info will save someone from doing what I didbuying twice as much as needed  Now we get to eat them  0
-1,Some kind soul here on amazon had recommended I try again to find old fashioned ginger snaps and I believed the 9 5star reviews that these would fill the bill Dumb of me I confess I should have gone to store to find a bag and try them But I got the pack of 12 Now I have food to contribute to the local Food Pantry There is NO flavor to these cookies They arrived very quickly as I live in Illinois where they are made They are fresh have the crunch have the appearance of old fashioned ginger snaps but there is no flavor at all Believe me please if you are looking for the decided taste of ginger and molasses you can avoid these Baking your own seems the only alternative since they are clearly not making old fashioned ginger snaps on a commercial scale anymore I give up
1,Hard to review such a subjective thing as hot sauce but I do love this stuff It has a really nice flavor and not killer spicy Its easy to try this stuff out since just about every Vietnamese restaurant in the country has it on all their tables
1,This is spicy without being overly hot  The family absolutely loves the flavor and I cant keep it in the pantry
-1,This water is disgusting and tastes like another brand also sold at Costco The after taste is stale bread I ordered 2 cases of httpwwwamazoncomgpproductB00BN6BX9Mrefohdetailso08s00i00ieUTF8psc1 when I got this with a coupon and subscribe  save discount and now Im choking this downMove on to something else if you want a clean crisp coconut water this definitely isnt it
-1,From what I remember Hamburger Helper used to come with enough pasta for more than one person I would have to buy four boxes to feed my three kids I can make this meal on my own for free What a rip off
1,the best chicken basebouillions available still very salty but the flavor means you dont need to use a much as cubes
1,On time  Intact  As advertised  No problems  A well known retail item of consistent quality  Not much more to be said
1,Just right with that cup of cofee in the morning
1,If you are still committed to being healthy while enjoying the flavor of your foodif you are still a hippy in your heart if not your affect you already know Braggs It us the best soy sauce replacement out there Aminos not salt Get it
-1,dont buy these unless you really want to waste money taste horrible and trying to pop these in place of corn was a joke
1,Ive used this great tasting product low sugar low calorie for years Recently I compared this to the other brand listed bowl made with Splenda The splenda product was just too sweet insufficient chocolate flavor Pity it surely was more healthy  I guess Ill have to formulate my own product using STEVIA in lower quantity Wish me luck
-1,Ive never tasted the Stevia powders and the drink recipe I made only called for half a pack in a cup of green tea Sure wish I had not added it because the entire drink went down the drain The taste was so strong that I just could not get past it Takes some getting used to but not for me
1,I drink this daily for liver support It does taste a bit bitter but I really enjoy it in the evenings after dinner I steep one bag in a very large mug of water for up to 30 minutes I dont like really hot tea and my cup is somewhat insulated I purchase this regularly on subscribe and save so its the best price around
1,My kids loved these chocolate toaster pastries on the mornings we were running late and needed to grab something quick on the way out the door
-1,I wanted to like this I like ginger teas for upset stomachs I love cranberries in most forms Unfortunately this flavor was just too far out there for meTexture of the oatmeal was okay but not great
1,Love the convience of the powdered milk Does not spoil but once opened it has to be put in a tightly sealed container  I sure wish the company would do that to  make it easier for the buyers  Long shelf life and great to use in an emergency when you dont have whole milk on hand
1,It has lots of specks of vanilla beans in here The taste is wonderful It is fabulous mixed in to plain yogurt
-1,It cooks well but still has that dense sour bitter taste that is typical of any gluten free breads that I have tried I regret buyingthisin bulk without trying it first
1,I had purchased some extract beans from another company and was looking forward to trying the higher grade beans  When I opened the package which arrived promptly I was not blown away by a heavenly aroma of vanilla and at first was dissapointed the beans however were are moist and plump and when I made a custard with them the flavor was rich and heavenly  I put the beans into a couple zip lock bags and put them away and a couple days I started smelling this amazing smell like REALLY nice pipe tobacco it of course was the beans I bought a nice airtight container for themThese are fantastic and far FAR better than anything Ive ever gotten from the grocery store I will be buying these again and again
-1,I purchased this from Honeyville since it was suggested in a review  was a little less expensive  I made banana bread with this first as a test  Because if the banana bread I love doesnt come out right then nothing will  The banana bread was bad  It was grainy  bland  you can taste it And it looked weird  The texture was off I make amazing banana bread I threw it out  Ive never used anything but regular flour to bake so I thought I would try this almond flour since its suppose to be much healthier wmuch less carbs  I thought it might be a miracle flourbut its not  I have yet to find anything wless carbs or less sugar or less this and lighter that that tastes good  Lifes too short not to have decent banana bread
-1,I will not buy this again all the grocery and personal items such as six bars of soap items were thrown together with no care as to breakage or damage
1,I am very pleased with the quality of this herbal tea  In my opinion there is nothing that even compares to this tea as far as quality taste and benefits enjoyed I like ordering this by the 6pack from Amazon because it is more economical than buying it a pack at a time from the local health food store
-1,The serial labels on the boxes says it is dark berry cherry but the box is the green tea raspberry version It must be replacement for cherry BEWARE
1,I used this for extra texture in both soups and stews and it worked fine  A bit of careful use of seasoning and you would swear it is meat
1,These are really handy for lunches and onthego as they say  The single pack keeps us from devouring a whole can which I also buy sometimes in a 3pack in a day No selfcontrol where these are concerned but having to open a new bag is a deterrent  Ha  Enjoy
1,The aroma of this caramel fills the room Everyone says 34Wow that smells great34 What more is there to say
1,I dont know why grocery stores always feel the need to stop carrying this classic dinner in a box This is as popular as Kraft mac and cheese The box tomato sauce a pound of burger and about 12 cup of red of wine added makes the best spaghetti in such little time When they stopped carrying it for a while at my local grocery store I tried different packages homemade and bottled sauces and I could never get anything as good as the Kraft mix My family loves when I make it
-1,SodaStream cola is much less weight making it more cost effective to ship SodaStream cola tastes so great so why would you want to drink this anymore Plus u can put the SodaStream cola flavor on ice cream  use it to sweeten your cereal instead of milk Soda Stream has just made a better cola than Coke Too bad for Coke Sodastream makes machines that use the 60L carbonating bottle  the 130L carbonating bottle  I use the fountain Jet that can use the 130L carbonating tank I like the larger carbonating tank  get a spare You can switch the 60L bottle out for a larger one when you exchange it Also you will wan 2 use cold refrigerated water 2 carbonate with some extra  carbonating bottles that you put water in  keep in the fridge Also get the MyWater flavors which are excellent with seltzer water which you now will be able to make Try using less syrup to make the sodas than advised  you may prefer that The MyWater flavors I just use a tiny drop per liter way less than the half a teaspoon recommended Also the Sodastream ice sticks are great  can be used to cool water down for carbonating
-1,These are god awful crackers thay dont taste like anything close to white cheddar they taste like a flavorless cracker  I am upset that I wasted my money on these nasty things I love annies products but this is not a winner in my book  I have heard that the sour cream and onion are the best so I am going to give those a try next but word of warning buy one box at a store first before purchasing online you will be glad you did  The big reason I love annies so much is everything they make is sutibale for vegetarians meaning they use renetless free cheese so thats why I love them
-1,Very disappointed in these cookies  I was hoping for a something great and ended up with extremely dry cookies some were already broke on arrival and others broke by just opening the individual bags The cookies are small  the image here makes them look a decentnormal size but they really are a bit smaller Case they are shipped in is great for storage in fact that was probably the best thing about the purchase Look elsewhere for Dark Chocolate chunk cookies thoughunless you like dark crumby hard ones
-1,ANNIE CHUNG PRODUCTS ARE HORRID  GROSSLY STICKY TOO SALTY NOT AS PICTURED OR DESCRIBED NO VEGETABLES  I WOULDNT EAT THIS CRAP IF I WERE STARVING
-1,Didnt do anything for me except give my heartburn Gave it to some friends they love love it
1,Really tastes like Ritz mini cheese crackers8230 very good flavor and I like that is is healthier than the mainstream brand  Wish the boxes were bigger though
1,JUST LIKE MAMA MADE LOVE IT I WILL BE BACK FOR MOREHOW MUCH EASYER CAN IT GETJUST HEAT N EAT
-1,I read another review of this product that stated that this products first and main ingredient is whey  Whey is a byproduct of milk remember that little Miss Muffet sat on her tuffet eating her curds and whey  Whey has a somewhat acidic taste that is rather crude  Cheddar cheese is way down the line in terms of percentage quantity in this stuff  I couldnt think of what this stuff tasted like until I read the other review  Its taste does not resemble that of cheddar cheese  I knew the product had an odd taste which I did not care for  I just didnt realize what that taste was until I came across the other review  There are no ingredients listed on the label  Now I understand why most liked the product  I assume because they are used to the taste of boxed macaroni and cheese products available in the grocery store with the orangeyellow powder in the packet inside the box  And most have come to think of that taste as cheese  Finer tastes however will reject this stuff I think because it has little cheese  Cheddar cheese is made with the by products of milk as well  The big difference is the cultures that are added to produce the various types of cheese  Plus the aging  Whey requires no aging or cultures  Another of the characteristics of whey is that it has little orangeyellow color  This stuff has food colorings added to produce the appearance you see in the bag  I read another review where the writer complained about the lack of labeling  I agree because it is important to most to know what they are consuming  If you look at the ingredients of some of the other cheese powders you will see cheddar as the first ingredient unlike this stuff  I believe the reason that this product has no ingredient labeling is to hide that fact  By regulation ingredients are to be listed in the order of the percentage contained therein  In other words the first ingredient would be the highest percentage and therefore the last ingredient would be the lowest quantity contained  Im not sure what the percentage of cheddar cheese is in this stuff but its way down the line and not the first  I have tasted other cheese powders with ingredient lists  Some of best are those with cheese as the first listed ingredient not the 3rd or 4th  I really dont like the taste of whey powder  It is crude and acidic  And that is to me what this stuff tastes like  I doubt whether Ill buy any more of this  To each his own taste though  I dont purport to know what anyone else prefers
-1,I dont think it matters which soup at hand you purchase cuz they dont stand UPRIGHT long enough to heat the souphad it flip overspilling contents out of course I will NOT purchase again
1,I ordered the Pecan Shortbread and the Chocolate Walnut cookies in July 2006  They were shipped in the same box  The Chocolate Walnut cookies arrived in perfect condition but the Pecan Shortbread cookies were all broken up into little pieces in all of the 6 individual boxes inside the case pack  I tried to return them online through my account login but it says this item is not eligible for return  So Ill be phoning Amazon on Monday to figure out how to remedy thisRegarding the cookies themselves I love the Pecan Shortbread cookies and Ive been buying them locally for about 4 years  I like them better when theyre kept in the fridge it just gives them a better crunch for my tastes  If you need to avoid gluten these are a winner  I just hope the warehouse people stop giving these things the drop test
-1,Taste ok but doesnt not work if you want to use it for slimming  However dont mind the taste just for the sake of drinking healthy tea
-1,I DIDNT LIKE THE TEXTURE AND IT WAS WAY TOO SWEET  I WAS THINKING IT WOULD BE MORE LIKE CORN POPS
1,Im a 60 woman who has had trouble sleeping for years  Ive been using NightyNight tea for some time now and noticed it sometimes left me feeling groggy in the morning  So I decided to try this one instead  Woke up feeling much more refreshed and I enjoy the flavor too  So now this is my go to evening tea and the NightyNight is saved for anticipated problem nights  Since this is less expensive I win twice  Hurray
1,I bought these because they have less salt than other versions  They are very tasty While they are not low sodium by any means they have enough less to make it worthwhile to me about 700 mg for the whole bowl  which is considered 1 serving not 12 a bowl as with others and then double the sodium  The price is about what I pay in the store with shipping so I went for the convenience of to my door delivery
1,I bought a bunch of HH boxes at the local market as they were on sale for 4 for 5 and Chili Cheese was one of the varieties I picked My family usually prefers to just stick to either Beef Pasta or Lasagna but I thought the sale would be a good chance to try new onesThe Chili Cheese takes mostly milk with 2 full cups called for and only 23 cup water To be honest it smelled pretty awful while it was simmering and I wasnt really looking forward to eating it However it wasnt too bad The main thing was that the kids absolutely loved it with both of them asking for seconds and my son requesting the leftovers for home lunch the next dayId buy it again but probably wont cook it as often as our other favorites
-1,The case was packaged with other foods and 12 of the cans were VERY dented  The boxed foods came fine and nothing else in the box was crushed or dented which means the cans were dented when they were put into the box for shipping  I would definitely not purchase cans this way again
1,This is a great snack that is healthy and low calorie plus if you are gluten free it is a great find  Love to eat this
1,I really like this mix Ive used it in muffins which are great I mixed in frozen blueberries Ive also used it as breading and it worked really well The pancakes were good however they were kind of flat The mix has really good flavor it is way better than Bobs Redmill pancake mix Pamelas products are very good
1,Its sugara 10 lb bag of sugar  Fresh tasty and sweet  Not much more I can say about sugar now
-1,This product was fine qualitywise but I am writing this for other foodadventurers who like to try new things this product is about 50 nori flakes  Rather than a seasoning with just a hint of nori to it what I was hoping for this is nori with other seasonings and all I could taste was the bitter noriIf you love nori or sushi then read other reviews to decide whether or not this is for you
1,My family has enjoyed this for around 40 years  I would add chopped cooked chicken and some peas and carrots and make a casserole  Whenever I found a store that carried it I would buy a dozen boxes  If I had known it was going to be discontinued I would have bought a lot more  I hope they bring it back
1,50 odd years ago I sold this product as a high school fund raiserThe product is every bit as good although needless to say more expensiveWell worth the money even todayI was so happy to find this product on Amazon
1,I went to UK for the first time a couple of years back My friends introduced me to Marmite as something some people enjoyed when they couldnt afford eggs and bacon The Mr said it was made from a byproduct of beer I thought he was joking at first  Spread it thinly on a piece of dry toast served properly he demonstrated then handed to me It was surprisingly strong but I liked it Savory or savoury as they would spell it like bacon or other cooked meats but none of the awful fat or grease Its not terribly hard to find here since the advent of shopping with the wonderful world wide web so I have been able to enjoy this in the US as a snack between meals on one slice of whole wheat bread often a late night sandwich with room temperature cheese and tomato
-1,this tastes NOTHING like hazelnuts  anyone who thinks so is just being deceived by the label  god only knows what is really in here
-1,Oh my god I expected so much more from a food with 45 starsThis tastes worse than the cheapest spaghetti at a cafeteria Like canned foodI couldnt even eat half a bowl let alone a whole box
-1,I sprinkled this on my cats  food to help their appetite entice them to eat more Its supposed to taste like cheese Cats are supposed to love it They didnt I read where some people use it in place of cheese I tasted it Whoano wonder the cats didnt want it I donated it to a neighbor who used it She loved it Go figure I guess were all born with different taste buds Mine say no to nutritional yeast Your buds may care to differ
-1,Please note that this is not a review on the taste of the product  it is a review for what I believe would be the majority of people considering the purchase of this product  those intending to go wheat free  gluten free for the health benefits  weight loss etc  This is not a product that fits  Its just a trade of one high glycemic index ingredient for othersIf your intent is to go gluten free onlyspecifically  this meets the bill  If your intent is to go wheat free  in the literal sense this also meets the bill  But if your intent is to go wheat free in the sense of the book Wheat Bellies and avoid high glycemic index foods that promote high insulin and fat retention  this is NOT the product to do it  As indicated in the Wheat Bellies blog Wheat raises blood sugar higher than nearly all other foods including table sugar and many candy bars The few foods that increase blood sugar higher than even wheat include figs dates and other dried fruits and rice starch cornstarch tapioca starch and potato starchthe most common ingredients used in glutenfree foods A glutenfree whole grain bread for instance is usually made with a combination of brown rice potato and tapioca starches These dried pulverized starches are packed with highlydigestible highglycemic index carbohydrates and thereby send blood sugar through the roof This contributes to diabetes cataracts arthritis heart disease and growing belly fat This is why many celiac patients who forego wheat and resort to glutenfree foods become fat and diabetic Glutenfree foods as they are currently manufactured are very poor substitutes for wheat flourI took a look at this product so that I may have some bread  wheat free  This is not a good substitute
-1,This was my goto hot sauce back in my High School days  But after years of using it Ive come to realize that not only is it nothing special but its actually just  not goodFor people who are looking for a miniscule kick its decent  And its probably a good 34access sauce34 for people who arent sure about their ability to handle spicy stuff  But honestly even as someone with a fairly sensitive tongue I find the burn completely unnoticeable  It essentially just tastes like vinegar  Theres nothing to itId recommend looking into other mild sauces  There are many others with a comparable burn that have a great deal more flavor  Id recommend Tropical Pepper Cos Papaya Curry sauce over this any day of the week for example  It has a good flavor for its price and basically the same 34burn34 value as Franks RedHot  Like Tobasco this is something that is popular because its a recognizable brand despite being of a fairly cheap low quality
-1,For the price these things are overpriced I think  Sure they are healthy and look cool but that comes at a price  The soup is actually decent and I like sipping the broth after I eat soup so this was why I tried this  Only takes about 1 minute in the microwave and your good to go  The only downfall to these cups is that even though I mixed it up good after microwaving the noodles stay on the bottom once you are done sipping it  But if I can save these cups and put regular soup in for the future I guess that would be cool  But I dont think you can dishwasher these cups  2 stars for the taste and nothing else  3 stars less because of price noodles and size
-1,everything in the nutrition label under carbohydrates is sugar dietary fiber is sugar but digests very slow so can be ignored mostly sugar alcohols are better for those who need to avoid sugar but over 70 of the carbs in these cookies are neither fiber nor sugar alcohol if you want truly sugar free your best bet is finding cookie recipes that use almond flour
1,In  March 2014 I ordered this great variety box and the individual bags were stamped with  expiration date of November 20 2014Works for me
1,Best gluten free pancake mix ever  Thought we would need an order every 4 months  Now we use it so fast that we order it every 2 months  Friends who eat with us would never know it was gluten free if we didnt tell them  Love to chop pecans and add or frozen blueberries
1,Coffee preferences are very personal  Before Keurig I recall a lot of debate in a small office at the salon etc  I decided to try the Butter Toffee because of all the great reviews and because I like Butter Toffeeflavored candies  It smells great but it tastes a little bitter to me  My cleaning lady on the other hand LOVES it  She suggested I try it with a little milk or coffee creamer the way she takes it  I usually drink mine black but I decided to try it HER way  A little milk does mellow the taste making it more like the butter toffee it purports to be
-1,We might not be a gourmet club but we know when something looks and tastes like wall paper paste And please dont get us started on the strange smellI have used Hamburger Helper for years admittedly not that often but had never before used the Stroganoff variety Well we will never ever use it again What a waste of perfectly good beef And FYI I thoroughly followed the directions and used fresh lean hamburger purchased only an hour before HonestGross
1,All you need to do is full water to line And heat for 3 minutes Easy Kids love it For those days you dont have time or in a hurry Just nice to have for backup Better than regular boxes of Mac and cheese which require butter and more cooking time  Not the healthiest option but on rare occasions
-1,Ive consumed products of this nature most of my life but these just fell far short of being any good To put it bluntly theyre just too greasy and chewy There are many products of this nature in the same price range that are of far higher quality so theres really no excuse for making something this poorlyRight out of the bag they were very greasy to the touch and left an orange grease on my fingers The casing and filling seem like wet paper with seasoning and the filling appeared to be the cheapest meat you could pull from an animal and still call it meat Ive eaten beef sticks in this same price range that are clearly beef with much better texture and consistencyThese sticks also contain mechanicallyseparated chicken which is a pretty disgusting product I try to avoid Watch some being made sometime and youll never eat it againIf you like greasy spicy meatstuff in a chewy paperlike casing youll like these If you would like a bit of quality and texture in a beef stick look elsewhere If I had to describe these with one word it would be nasty
-1,So this is chocolate and fudge  I tried it after a day at work to relax  and hold me over until i got home  Close but no cigarChocolate taste on the coating is minimal though melts with finger heat just like the real thing  Body is crumbly heavy and bland  I noticed a full but backgroundish chemical taste not oder  There was little feel or taste for a chocolate fudge energy barYes its edible  Recommended  Ill leave that to individual tastes in case you buy it
-1,While these nuts are edible I am most disappointed in them  Not all of them are crisp and crunchy  Some of them are soft and chewy  The taste is not very consistent from nut to nut  I was expecting more from a Planters product
-1,I have been drinking tea for years This particular blend of green and white tea by the folks at Celestial Seasonings is quite possibly the worst cup of tea I have ever had Green tea naturally has a grassy kind of taste to it but it is very light and hidden behind the smooth sweet and slightly bitter taste the rest of the flavor produces I love the taste of a solid green tea however this is anything but I dont know what exactly went wrong with this blend of green and white but the final product remains consistant no matter how many times I try to give CS a chance to prove it was just a bad batch I have recieved The smoothness and slightly sweet flavor is totally gone and you are left with nothing NOTHING but bitter grass I am not a particularly picky tea drinker folks I can tell you of the kind I have had which is better than the others but I still can find enjoyment in most teas I consume This particular brand is just totally unpleasing to the pallet in every way and there is no way I can possibly recommend you avoid it enough
1,This herbal tea is well balanced and pleasant  It tastes to me like good real lemon but not acidic  The ginger seems just enough  Bonus you can use the bag twice and get a good cup of tea the second time  Also its nice to steep this with black tea and get a bit of caffeine if you choose along with the ginger  lemon flavors
-1,I ordered this because the title and description both say 34pack of 2034 which I thought was a good deal but what I received was a pack of 10 which is of course not such a great dealPlease update the product title and description to accurately describe what youre sellingThe product itself is excellent so I will update my review if this misinformation is corrected
-1,I purchased several of these the other day after all of the hype Ive heard surrounding themLong story short they taste awful I cant quite place the taste but it just reminds me of something thats very stale and expired tasting Very unpleasant to the point where I threw out the bottle after a few sips
-1,The most critical review saysDo not buy for the Cranberry Apple and Tangerine OrangeThe picture and description is NOT accurate for this product as the shipped package replaces Cranberry Apple and Tangerine Orange with Wild Berry and True Blueberry  A few years back I bought a box of 6 packages of the Fruit Tea Sampler and it was different As stated above they have now replaced two of the flavors with cheaper fare I looked at the graphic before ordering a few days ago and it said 18 tea bags I wondered how they could do this What I got before was 5 flavors 4 tea bags each Yes 5 times 4  20 How did they get 5 flavors and only 18 tea bags Well I found out today when I received the package the obvious fact being that two of the flavors only have 3 tea bags being two of the better flavors Raspberry Zinger and Country Peach Passion Doh
-1,I had such high hopes However after both times I have made this bread now Im bummed to have to state8230I too am among those whose stomach just cannot tolerate this gluten free bread mix at all Unfortunately I get pretty severe gastrointestinal problems
-1,As others have posted this bar is not anywhere near anything I would ever eat again  While I use protein bars to supplement my appetite throughout a day this one was as tasteless as Ive come across  Bland blah and borderline nasty
-1,YUCK  I hate this popcorn  The kernels are shriveled up and pitiful looking and it tastes like cardboard  Dont waste your money  I will never buy this again  However Black Jewell Crimson bought here at Amazon is really good
1,For well over a year I have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food  Before I started doing this I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches  Even though I have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period Tapatio Salsa Picante Hot Sauce has set itself apart from the others and has become a favorite  When I was given a bottle of this hot sauce for the first time as far as I remember I was just expecting a typical hot saucethis is not typical hot sauce  It is hotter than the other hot sauces that I like but it is not overpowering and does not have a searing heatmore like a peppery heat  In addition Tapatio Salsa Picante Hot Sauce has a pleasing exceptional flavor  This is a hot sauce that I prefer to use only for special occasions  It is recommendable
1,These are great because I prefer no salt and my husband salt so lightly salted is a great compromise for both of us
-1,I had to doublecheck the expiration date Yep expires a year from now Still it smells and tastes like oil gone bad Theres soy Theres flax Theres something sweet But its all drowned out by the taste and smell of the bad oil I opened two bars to be sure and passed one to my coworker to smell Yeah gross she said I usually eat stale stuff but I wouldnt eat thatAlthough I purchased this exact product locally I did not buy it from this retailerIm surprised and disappointed  their pumpkin granola cereal is my favorite cerealI much prefer Cascadian Farms crunchy pumpkin granola bars but theyre hard to find Kashis are good if you dont have a wheat or a gluten allergy
1,While these tasty graham cracker flavored snacks are appropriately named they could also be called cinnadisappearing  I opened a packet popped one in my mouth and left the packet on the kitchen counter when the doorbell rang  You guessed it  When I returned they were all goneObviously these bitesized treats have become popular at our house and if you like graham with a hint of cinnamon youll relish them tooCautionary note If youre not alone in the house carry your packet with youTheyre also nifty lunch box treats as well as a quick pickmeup at the officeEnjoy
-1,Im here to tell everyone the truth about this so called tuscan milkIt was my great grandfather Pasquale Iandoli who originally perfected the recipe for a full bodied incredibly satisfying milk beverage  It was a great success in his home town of Apice Benevento Italy and brought with it large quanties of money  With that money he was able to act as a supporter of Mussolini  Well I dont have to tell you that with the fall of facism Pasquale had to leave Italy and fast  He only had one copy of the recipe with him and while traveling to America it was stolen by a shipmate  This person subsequently popularized it in the states and ignorantly claims it to be Tuscan milk when clearly it tastes distinctly of Napoli
-1,This is not pure stevia Buying stevia for the benefits is not what this product does MALTODEXTRIN is the number one main ingredient and by the way stevia was added to it I have been using pure stevia products for 20 years and always read my ingredients I wish companies would stop fooling people into believing they now have the miracle sweetener Its just like making donuts and adding a touch of steviarevised review bc I had mixed up 5 star rating of another stevia product WHICH IS PURE STEVIA and accidentally gave it a one star ratingTHIS DESERVES a zero rating bc it a product with the main ingredients being SUGAR with stevia added to it
1,I have only used this product with pancake mix but it works great for that  The mix I use is 13 cup per serving but calls for one egg per cup This product works great to make a single serving and doesnt impart an 34off34 taste at all in addition to being more convenient
1,Celestial Seasonings Mint Magic is DEFINITELY a Rocky Mountain high Its a delicious blend of mint and of all thingschicory Mint Magic is mostly sweet Its a serenenoncaffeinated tea The wizard on the cover is a Gandalf lookalikeso its perfect for enjoying hobbit tea time with it One could watch all ofThe Lord of the Rings  The Motion Picture Trilogy Platinum Series Special Extended Editionwhile drinking this Its a perfect accompaniment to snacksdessert even breakfast Drink the magic
1,I absolutely love theseThey are very good by themselves as a snack or on yogurt with some fruit Try to use them by the exp date I tried having them after that date and they were not to good on my tongue
-1,this tastes nothing like a real cheesecake not even close to what you would buy already made my kids like it but as for me and my husband we wont eat it again
1,True story I surfed online looking for difficult and expensive to find gourmet ingredients when I came across this listing  Every review raved about the excellent service provided by JR Mushrooms  I phoned them to ask a question about refrigeration vs shelf storage and got a voicemail  I left a message and five minutes later the man himself personally called and gave me friendly and professional answers to my questions  I ordered these truffles and several other items  The next morning there was a little personal email from JR thanking me for the order and by noon the order had arrived although I chose the cheapest shipping  THIS is the best customer service I have ever experienced with online shopping  Thanks
1,I am new to being on a plants only diet  I did some research before buying Frontier Brand  I knew it would be small pieces so no complaints here  I find that makes it easier to blend together when creating sauces  It is a learned taste but I regularly sprinkle it on everything nowI only buy it here due to the reasonable price  I wish it was a subscribe item  I would buy it in a larger size if it was availableI keep cheesy sauce in my fridge to put on many things pizza quinoa stir fries and tortillas  The right recipe and you have a wonderful mac n cheese
-1,I have to agree with the sizeable minority here that this olive oil is just too bitter at least the Fall 08 bottling  The flavor starts a bit grassy but then a flat mouthpuckering astringency takes over At first I hoped that the bitterness would mellow with a little shelf time but after year in a cool dark place the flavor is the same  I consider myself a foodie and I love strong flavors but this oils bitterness is just so strong that it overpowers any other qualities  I have tried a variety of premium olive oils from the California Europe and Australia and have never experienced such an unbalanced olive oil  Given the number of good reviews out there I hope I just got a bad batch
1,Paired with oatmeal I have had more milk than my daughter can consume Ive been breastfeeding for 6 weeks now and this week is when I noticed a difference in my supply  I added the tea maybe around week 23 and only a cup a day so i dont even drink the recommended 34  I didnt like the taste at first but now I really enjoy the flavor and almost crave it Of course I love that its organic too
-1,I normally love Walden Farms foods but this sauce is not at all what I expected It has a very bitter acidic taste to it If youre looking for a substitute for sweet barbeque sauce this is not it
1,I bought this item recently as I was wanting to try my hand at making some home made laundry detergent As always Amazon had a good price for it and I gave it a try  It is a reliable product and worked as intended for my laundry detergent Baking soda has so many uses and I will buy again  The price was right
1,WOW   I found myself tasting a sugar cookie with vanilla frosting  The vanilla flavor is genuine and truly deliciousthe color is pretty as well  After the second cup I believe that I can make the switch from coffee to tea  Celestial Seasonings have outdone themselves 
-1,I love parsley and add it to my cooking all the time I thought Id like this tea but unfortunately I was mistaken
-1,Its all well and good to indulge our creative writing and have a little fun at Amazons expense but what do we really know about this socalled Tuscan Milk I will endeavor to prove that it is neither Tuscan nor milkEveryone knows nascut an anagram and almost a backwards spelling exactly of tuscan is Romanian for born specifically the past participle of naste So what we have here is a thinly veiled admission that this liquid has its origins in Eastern rather than Southern Europe and thus offers a flavor more Balkan than Mediterranean Transylvania to Tuscany is exactly one thousand miles and allowing for the fact that the earth rotates on its axis one thousand miles per hour is it any coincidence that Lao Tzu wrote A journey of one thousand miles begins with a single stepAs for the question of color over origin we are presented with no less of an obvious obfuscation To be sure the pictures of Tuscan Whole Milk 1 Gallon 128 fl oz appear as white as newly fallen arctic snow But color theory teaches us that white is after all the combined color spectrum Given the geographical and lexicographical insights above are we hinting at vampiric energy drinks or merely an FDA investigation of immense nay bovine proportions Either way I think Ill have a good old fashionedMexican Coke 24 Packinstead
1,I wont lie I like my tea strong So strong I often use 3xs what I should for high quality stuff you could say Im a bit of a tea junkie so could the 120 kinds of teas in my home This is one of those kinds of teas that you dont want to call tea and that is strong enough to drink 1 bag to 1 cup especially since it IS best served with a little less water and a little more milk I like to drink a LOT of tea at once so I tend to take 2xs the water with 3 bags told you a lot and then add milk The milk MAKES this tea I guess some could use soy stuff but I like mine straight from the mama cows udder thanksYogi tea definitely gets an award for consistency the box look changed over time but the tea has remained consistent they are precise I like that in a tea maker
-1,The Slim Jim meat is very bad The meat is dry and the taste of the meat is bad I do not like this meat The sticks are useful I like meat in a stick
-1,I place my order on Janaury 23 for the noodles  Due to overwhelming demand the supplier ran out and I had to wait for restocking  Once the item was restocked 29 I was sent an Email with a link to UPS  After a few days 213 the status of my package went from receiving billing information to exception  The package was damaged in transit and has yet to be replaced its now 223  Seller is soso about responding to communication they usually respond its just they are not quick about it and until I actually receive the product I am very hesitant to use this seller again
1,But I have a Senseo machine and I get the intended results creama on top of the coffee but I doubt the standard pod coffee makers will give you the same results I also have a Keurig which has more options for coffee Cost per cup with pods is lower but Ive never tried these with any of the other machines that use pods
1,OK so most people seem to like this coffee its got a strong rating 4 12 at the moment but there are still those that say they dont It will always be subjective many people detest Starbucks coffee but millions more like it Some like it bold some like it weak some like it mild some like it bitter some like it sweet no way to please everyoneThis coffee is on the mild side meaning it has flavor but its not overpowering and is moreso on the sweeter side meaning its not bitter like dinerhouse coffee The great thing about this flavor is that it blends excellent for those that like to flavor their coffee because it is not bitter but still has a noticeable coffee flavor it compliments most flavored creamers Ive had many many different types of coffees with many different types of creamers and it can be a real balancing act to find the right blends The senseo medium roast so far has been the best starting point meaning nobody Ive personally made coffee for has said anything but complimentary things about it Some still like a more bold or bitter coffee but so far nobody has said poor things about this coffee I use a single pod in approx 6oz of coffee in a cheap Hamilton Beach drip machine with filtered water and it turns out greatOne other thing sometimes batches taste slightly different from oneanother its a product from a plant when all is said and done and while controls are put into place to regulate the taste sometimes batches are slightly more bold or bitter than another it happens with all manufacturers including Folgers and other large manufacturers which Ive personally tasted radical variations Ive ordered this 6pack around 6 times so far and only one batch was slightly odd tasting had a much more noticeablebitter flavor to it other than that it has been very consistent I left the bag slightly open on that batch in essence making it go flat so it wasnt so bitter While these packets are sealed make sure you store them in a sealed container after opening to preserve the flavorOne other thing to watch out for increasing costs This pack is still a great deal on Amazon but I am worried since they have made the decision to pull from retail outlets that it will increase in cost on Amazon as well I still love this coffee but if it goes up to 40 for a 6pack of this I may be rethinking the coffee I purchase Keep it low in cost and at the same level of flavor and well all be happy
1,This is exactly what you buy it for  LemonGinger I find that a touch of honey rounds it off nicely Its great if you have cold symptoms or an upset stomach
1,I like mccormik because of the solid quality and potent flavors and smell Right on the money as usual Try in tomato soupp
-1,I find most of the Senseo coffee products to be tasteless maybe watered down but not fullbodied or delicious  I have tried several different Senseo varieties but none are noteworthy and I wouldnt recommend any of them  I am going to try other pod brands
1,I was sick for quite a few days before I could get back to the store and get myself some of this tea I tried a few packets in another sampler box and was impressedOnce I realized this tea had hyssop in it I was sold on it Hyssop is known for helping you overcome colds The deal is hyssop has antiviral properties For this reason you should not drink this tea on a regular basis but rather save it for when you get a cold Hyssop should not be used for extended periods of time and should not be taken by pregnant women as it can cause miscarriage So says one of my herbal booksThis tea also contains Elder which is a known gypsy cure for colds That is probably the reason this is called GYPSY cold careThe other ingredients in this tea include yarrow flower peppermint leaf rose hips Saigon cinnamon bark ginger safflower petals cloves and licorice It is a good tasting tea and seems to be very healingThree days after I started drinking about three cups a day my cold went away I will now keep this on hand and start drinking it the minute I get a sore throat Im very convinced that this tea helped me get wellPlease consult with your doctor before taking herbal remediesThe Rebecca Review
1,This is one of the better tasting Senseo pods out there but it is not Kona coffee  It contains only 10 Kona coffee the other 90 is something else  If you want Kona coffee go buy Kona coffee  This Kona blend wont taste anything like itNames aside as I stated this is one of the better tasting Senseo pods  Four stars are based on rating Senseo coffee  It would get less stars if I was just rating coffee
1,This is without a doubt one of the best mac and cheese products around  And it is good for you too  I noticed some negative reviews about the cheese sauce being too thin  YOU NEED TO DRAIN THE SHELLS REALLY WELL and this will remedy that  They are like tiny water buckets so I stirred and shook the water out of them while they were in my collander and it did the trick  ENJOY
1,I have a wheat allergy so I cant have most products  I decided to try Pamelas bread mix and it was GREAT
-1,I am a big fan of Pamelas Products Their plain shortbread and pecan shortbread are incredible So I was optimistic about the lemon shortbread cookies since Im a fan of everything lemonflavored These cookies were a too sour b soggy without the crumbly buttery texture of real shortbread and c they tasted like someone had sprayed Lemon Pledge furniture cleaner on regular shortbread then sealed it in plastic while damp Really they were that gross Not recommended
-1,I realize that taste in tea and particularly green tea is a matter of personal preference For me I found this tea to be unpleasant Opening the tea bag I detected an aroma reminiscent of lawn clippings As I drank the tea I find the unpleasant aroma becomes an unpleasant taste I am not sure how to describe it    perhaps wet lawn clippings or even a mossy taste I do not get the sharp bite I normally expect from a good green teaI will try this for a week and see if I am missing something but as for now I can not recommend purchasing this tea
1,I could eat this stuff every day It tastes great on its own with other things mixed in or as a side dish
1,Not sure what it is but different chamomile teas affect me differently  This one makes me feel very relaxed and is perfect for before bedtime  Others have ended up leaving me a little jittery or with no noticeable relaxation at all  This is great with a little honey and if youre lucky a good rain storm and youll sleep long and soundThis is the best price Ive found on this product even at Walmart  I go thru a package in about 34 weeks so 6 boxes is great for me  Its packaged great  The tea bags are enveloped in a packaging that closes over it to keep it fresh then the box is cellophaned  Stays fresh for a long long timeWorks great for me and I have teenagers  This should be a present for every mom when their kid turns 13
-1,I have a bout of gastritis and learned that coconut water is the natural way to help relieve those issues while fasting I tried it and it worked great but I tried two different brands Zico and Vita Coco I loved Vita Coco and hated Zico   the more I drank it the more I hated itwill not buy again
1,The blend is beautiful flavorful and gives of an incredibly fresh and strong pepper scent when ground The difference between these corns and those bought in a typical supermarket was evident I was pleased there were almost no broken corns or husk flakes in the bag  The packaging needs to be rethought though  The peppercorns come in a sealed cellophane bag that isnt really user friendly  Something self sealing would be preferable  If you try and tear off a corner on this bag the cellophane doesnt want to stop tearing when you do  Scissors are the best way to open and youll need to find an airtight container to store the rest after filling the grinder  Ill certainly be purchasing these again
1,This product is not even organic so I do not know where they come up with 1719 for a 3lb bag That is what I have been paying for it through Amazoncom Will be searching for less priced merchants Very good product  makes baked goods so much better than regular grainy brown rice flour This bag will not last very long if you do a reasonable amount of baking so make sure to have plenty on hand
1,Yummy BBQ Sauce and very thick I wished they used organic sugar instead of High Fructose Corn Syrup Since I dont use a lot I like the excellent price which is less expensive than grocery store Even more savings using Amazons Subscribe and Save Program Also this product is in a plastic container not a glass jar
-1,I did not like it I used it to sweeten Coffee and Tea Lemonade it did not work it appeared to separate from the liquids meaning you taste the stevia first and the liquids kicked in  It just did not blend like other sweeteners I tried
-1,I didnt like this brand of coconut water it has a strange after taste  There are other brands out there that are a lot better
1,Bought this for my pepper grinder I got myself to Christmas Love the taste of fresh ground pepper
1,Hadnt tried this until recently but Im hooked now Add it to anything to add some heat and more flavor   chili stirfry soups chicken dishes etc Try it
-1,Ive tried many ginger teas and this one is by far the best tasting  I add a little agave to sweeten it and its just perfect  Not too weak not too strongUPDATE AS OF FEB 1 2014  THIS TEA HAS CHANGED AND IS NOW ONE OF THE MOST TERRIBLE TEAS IVE EVER TASTEDI have been drinking this tea almost everyday for many months now but today I got my second bad order of it So it will have to be sent back or thrown away or whatever But it is now TERRIBLE TERRIBLE I was so loyal to this brand and this flavor but I cannot drink it anymore The smell is different the taste is absolutely awful Im going to email the company but in the meantime if you drink this tea stop It has changed and the change IS NOT for the better BOOO
1,Im not really a fan of Red Bull Rockstar etcWhen I drank Guru my opinion changed of energy drinks I havent looked much into the ingredients of competing products Im your pretty standard consumer but the fact that Guru makes it obvious whats in it advertising the natural aspect just gives me a piece of mindOrganic doesnt always mean good for you and its kinda stupid to assume unnatural ingredients  bad automatically but its just how I feel I just feel better drinking Guru knowing whats in it is something I can comprehendProsTastes goodDoesnt have any weird aftertaste or inspire feelings of remorseDoesnt hurt my teeth like other drinksConsNoneI know I could of made this review extremely technicalinformed but when it comes to food I just go with my gut
-1,This is just noodles and the vegetable is more of a garnish  I added chicken and broccoli so it was tolerable but not tasty
-1,Perhaps Annie Chun and the rest of the manufacturers on the hot  sour bandwagon understand hot and sour soup to be a completely different animal than I do  Then again  maybe notAfter discovering a love for hot and sour soup at our local Chinese restaurant I thought Id try some of the store brands that said hot and sour on them  BIG mistake  The hot and sour soup I am used to is a flavorful robust soup with chunks of tofu pork meat bamboo shoots egg and dried mushrooms laced throughout it  It is slightly tangy affair and a bit spicy on the paletteBy contrast  oh dear  Annie Chun has fallen into the same pitfalls the others have when trying to make a storebrand prepackaged hot and sour soup  I must admit I was interested when I saw that the noodles were fresh rather than dried  but when you add hot water to them along with the flavor packet and hot oil sachetugh  Tastes like someone strained a whole head of garlic and some chillies through a sieve and into a bowl of boiling waterThe dried veggies most noticeably the green onions are godawful  They have a consistency more akin to bad calamari and a taste that more closely resembles cardboard dont ask how I know what cardboard tastes likeJust awful  Do yourself a favor  go to your nearest Chinese restaurant and order like ten servings of hot and sour soup  Its usually about 3apop and portion it out into individual freezersafe tubs or sandwich bags  Freeze  Extract oneatatime from the freezer when you have the craving  MUCH HAPPIER
1,You know it is Bragg when it tastes good and is good for you  This is a tasty seasoning with the right mix of ingredients to make eating more enjoyable  Sprinkle it on just about anytbing and enjoy  A really healthy mix with no regrets after the fun
-1,Because of tummy troubles my doctor ordered me on a very bland diet  Well this stuff is JUST what the doctor ordered as it is almost completely tasteless  I cant give it a one star which qualifies as  hating it as I cant hate anything that has pasta as one of the ingredients but it is not good  It makes Kraft Mac and Cheese seem very exciting  I would not reorder and would fear ordering anything else from Annies  This would only be for young children who hate anything with a taste to it
1,Very authentic product tastes nearly like in Turkey the water makes a difference Very finely ground almost like powder easy to measure or spoon into water and boil
1,Flavor is good aromatic and spicy  no unhappy side effects Only needs a touch of sweetening or none at all
-1,I read where Dandelion tea could help with weight loss  Whether or not that is true I cant atest  After reading some of the potential side affects of drinking dandelion tea I decided it was not for me and tossed it out
1,This is another great dressing from Walden Farms Its caloriefree but has great taste As a warning I should note that its vinegarbased not creambased so if you dont like vinegar you might not have the same liking for this dressing that I do but I am definitely hooked on this and other Walden Farms dressings
-1,Ive only been giving my poodle mix 15 lbs these capsules for like two weeks now but Im already considering stopping them They havent really done much to help the fleas and I think they might be harming him because hes been drinking too much water On account of all the water he drinks he has to go pee A LOT and wakes me up in the middle of the night Im worried that the pills might be affecting his kidneys so I think Im going to stop giving them to him Thats too bad because I was really excited to give these to my pet since the reviews are really good Although I did see some possitve changes in him it hasnt been enough to outdo the possible negative consequences I also read that brewers yeast can cause bloating so Im not sure this is such a good idea after all Has anybody else experienced this
1,I have tried all the curris from Mae Ploy excluding the Panag and various other curry pastes out there Mae Play is a solid and affordable curry paste that keeps The Red has more heat but the green has more spice The Yellow and Matsaman curry paste dont really have any heat to me but do taste good as wellFor a holiday treat substitute eggnog for coconut milk with the green curry It is super delicious just be advised your GI tract WILL hate you later for doing so
1,This pudding is so good  Need I say more  Its so creamy and cold and just so perfect  I like to add strawberries to it too  Its a great snack
1,These boxes are about 1 each in Southern CA  I paid less than half that on Amazon  We dont eat this too much but the 24 count box is perfect if you plan to eat about 1 box a week  This is a smokin deal on Amazon
1,Great tea for any time of day hot or iced  Soothing for  stomach upsets  Great flavor with or without sugar or honey
-1,I was lazy ordered these No better then store brand dried mashed potatoes Will never buy them again unless I become a full 34prepper34
-1,No matter what combination of water and microwaving I use I can not make the noodles pleasant and soft like the stovetop version of Hamburger HelperQuite honestly this product is not turning out to be very palatable which is a crying shame given that I bought it here in bulkOn the upside as it is it will do in a pinch and its more satisfying and marginally healthier  but only marginally healthier  than say potato chips or other junk foods
-1,This soup is my favorite Progresso soup so my rating is for Amazons handling  Amazon is not properly packaging this product to arrive to the customer undamaged  Over half the cans were severely dented upon arrival however I was lucky and didnt have one spring a leak like some others have mentioned in their reviews  Will buy locally in the future as the Amazon price isnt really that competitive anyway
1,Im not a tea expert but I know what I like and this is it This is a flavored black tea with notes of citrus and vanilla a bit like panettone cake or King Arthurs fiore di sicilia flavoring Its a bit similar to Earl Grey but without that resinous aftertaste and more of a vanilla undertone Just in the canister the tea smells perfumed and perhaps overlyflavored but brewed the taste of the tea itself becomes more prominent making a dark rich fullbodied brew with an enchantingly subtle flavor profile It takes a bit of milk handily without turning weak and watery and rebrews nicely though rebrews dont take milk as well It chills well I prefer it plain when its cold It tastes delicious with breakfast and also at any time of the day Its ability to rebrew makes it more economical a choice tooAs black flavored teas go this ones a keeper for me I will definitely purchase it again and I recommend it heartily to tea drinkers
1,This is a very tasty tea  nice and spicy plenty of cinnamon and the ginger gives a nice bite and no caffeine  Every box Ive gotten has been fresh  My gripe however is the lack of strings  The box claims they save 35 million pounds of landfill waste every year by not using individual wrappers or stringstagsstaples  That seems like an exaggerated claim and the lack of strings and staples is a real annoyance in my book  It means I always should usecarry a spoon in order to agitate the bags a bit while steeping and remove them from the hot tea  Its so annoying I even considered only 3 stars  Mostly I drink tea at the office and bringing a spoon around with me to meetings is odd so instead I tend to wait until tea is cooler and use my fingers which also is odd  Individual wrappers I can do without because I drink frequently enough the tea doesnt go stale but please give me strings and staples
-1,I dont know what they do but if you open a can of tomato soup it taste very different from this stuff They added something not good to this The price is much higher than in the super market I will not be buying this stuff
1,I dont have an espresso machine and these pods are the nextbest thing Love em
-1,Flat coffee taste artificial vanilla blah  Of all the pods Ive tried in my Senseo these are the worst
-1,When searching for premium popcorn for the Little Bambino popcorn popper we won I bought a red popcorn just for fun Im sorry I didThe kernels of Wabash Valley Farms Vintage Red popcorn were stale They were dried outYou cant directly control the moisture locked in the dry kernels only the manufacturer can If there is not enough the kernels dont pop big enough they stop popping early there are a lot of unpopped kernels and the whole batch burns while you wait for the final slow pops Popping produces steam which prevents burning No steam no heat control No heat control burned popcornA few of the kernels were perfect They tasted great The red color was entertaining But just a fewTry another brand
1,I have a cup every night after dinner and it really relaxes me Funny enough this contains catnip I wonder if this is what the cats have been enjoying all along
1,Weve enjoyed Planters products for as long as I can remember  Seldom do we buy another brand and this canister was a good mix of cashew halves as well as pieces
1,I live in California and we arguably have some of the best cheeses in the world out here Im originally from New York where I worked 4 years in a Sicilian restaurant and my taste buds prefer whole milk products with low salt Ive tried a lot of dried cheddar cheeses in my cooking and baking but I have to admit that this cheese powder from Ohio of all places is the best I have ever used I am 50 years old but I also have to shamefully admit that by adding a teaspoon of this cheese powder to the mix I am once again like a little kid and I now occassionally enjoy a box of Kraft macaroni  cheese
-1,Beware the chemical poison BHT included in small dosages as a way of preserving this itemenough bht buildup can damage your body and or worse  Most countries make it illegal for companies to sell foods containing bht  the USA is one of the few that put the businesses before its citizens and allow for such misconducthopefully you will read this and think seriously about yours families health and start paying attention to what is foods
-1,Green tea  Kombuch is supposedly good for you but this product tastes worse than dirty socks water  I was not impressed but at least I tried  Then I got a recipe and got the stuff and mde it from scratch and it was a little sweet but drinkable
-1,Gluten free for sure And like most gluten free items you dont quite know what to expect for the taste knowing it wont taste like the regular flour version All I can say is that I have a sturdy stomach and enjoy almost any flavor But these well these I dont know what to say They were bland but had a distinct taste while not bad I would call it odd These were not for me and as many other reviewers have stated not these I cancelled my subscription to these and went and grabbed a glass of water
-1,Im a fan of the Pamelas Products line of cookies but this one tastes strange  It must be the agave sugar  When I think of biting into a shortbread cookie I expect something buttery and crumbly  This one is soft and chewy  I couldnt get over that concept  Normally a box of Pamelas cookies lasts 13 days the first box lasted about 2 weeks and then it was eaten only after every other 34good34 kind of Pamelas cookies was out of the house and this was our last resort  I had to encourage my husband to eat these just to finish them up and he refused them more times than taking one  I wont be buying these again
1,These honey roasted cashews are fantastic   and addictive You honestly need to parse out a small amount or youll eat half a can before you know it Served these to some guests They too couldnt believe how good they are They are worth every penny
-1,Did not do a thing to relax and just needed to get up in the night  It was not a great taste either
1,Read the reviews here with a grain of salt  A couple of people thought these were awful but I dont  I purchase all three flavors and eat whatever Im in the mood for and I enjoy all of them chocolate pb berry  Bottom line try a box purchased locally and if you like them buy them by the case at amazon for their cheaper price  My only complaint is that Amazon grocery doesnt consistently carry the chocolate flavor  If Amazon grocery is to thrive customers need to know they can find the products they want to buy on a consistent basis
-1,Because I could not stop for milkIt kindly came to meI ordered it through AmazonWhole milk sweet TuscanyThe driver though he knew no hasteNo Expediter heThe wait Four days and weekend tooIt seemed eternityMy milk it passed through NYCWhere traffic snarled in ringsSlow past the fields of grazing cowsWho nodded knowinglyIts expiration date passed tooAnd though the truck was chillVile germs digested lactose sweetAnd had their gruesome fillIt paused before my house at lastBy USPS GroundMy gallon jug 128 ounceThough oddly swollen roundMy joy is dashed My hope deniedAlas milk lacks the powerTo strive towards immortalityMy Tuscan milks gone sourS
-1,Recently Ive been searching for a good ginger tea  Preferably something that captures the awesome spiciness and flavor of ginger  Well I picked up this tea in a store because it clearly listed ginger as one of the top ingredients and you can even smell the spiciness in the tea bag  However once you brew it and I let it steep a long time you cant even taste any of the ginger  What happened to all the spiciness  I dont know but it doesnt make a good ginger tea  Furthermore it doesnt even taste good otherwise as it is really bland in flavorI suppose that there are still some health benefits to drinking this tea and it would be really good for someone who wants the benefits of ginger but cannot stand its taste  Personally though I was really let down by this tea hence the 2star ratingI discovered that you can make tea by directly boiling some slices of fresh ginger root  This produces a much more satisfying ginger taste and spiciness and is a whole lot cheaper  So if you are searching for spicy ginger tea just use a fresh root and skip expensive dried teas all together
1,I use so much of this stuff I got tired of buying the small jars at the supermarket  This package saves money  Spices get old if you do no use them in a year but I use this much and more in a year so saving a lot of cash
-1,I was so disappointed in these I LOVED the flavor of candy cigarettes as a boy I hadnt had them in years so I decided to spring for a case of them Wouldnt ya know it they not only changed the flavor noticeably but even the texture has changed They used to melt in your mouth and have a 34cool34 taste to them Not any more They are lumpy hard things They dont even paint the tip red anymore not that it matters but stillBoohiss
1,This really is the best sugarfree maple syrup Ive found The ones with sucralose have a weird chemical taste besides being unhealthy Maltitol a sugar alcohol is the sweetener used in this product My boys and husband love the maple flavor of this syrup
-1,In reading the reviews it seems some people have received okay tins and some of us have received smelly moldy stale horrible tasting tea  I usually read all the negative reviews and I did this time but ordered it any way hoping Id be one of the lucky ones Besides I dont know a whole lot about how Chinese teas are supposed to smell or taste  I smelled every can and some were okay but most had a strange smell that I would call musty  I figured the proof was in the tasting  I made a cup of oolong tea the one Chinese tea with which I am a little familiar and had to throw it out  It tasted worse than it smelled  The tins are cute and I almost kept the tea so I could have the tins but common sense says there is no use keeping something when it smells so strange
-1,Too pricey will not go here again  I am health conscious but now a  daysbudget conscious takes precedent  Thanks but no thanks
-1,I got a box for just over a buck on sale to try I dont have problems going but there are days where I barely do and its hard so I decided to try this on one of those days I drank before bed just like the box said let it sit in boiling water for 15 minutes Not even an hour after drinking the cramps started I spent the next hour maybe longer on the toilet It was not fun and I was exhausted I just wanted to sleep Finally after going more than I ever have in my whole life I was able to go to bed Thankfully I did not wake up due to cramping The next day I felt okay then I was out shopping and lo and behold the cramps started again I ended up going back home just to be safe I went and went and went throughout the afternoon wondering when I would ever stop I didnt stop going until in the eveningSo the reason for the two stars is the cramps They were bad Maybe not as bad as some I have had  before The instructions are not exactly honest especially how I drank the tea and not even an hour later was going So clearly it is different for everyone I will only drink this again if I am so constipated I havent gone in days that probably wont happen but its there just in case The product clearly works but the cramps just arent worth it too me Next time I will probably try brewing for only 5 minutes to see if this lessens the side effects The fact that it cleans you out is 5 stars
-1,It was okay for about 30 seconds then most of the flavor had gone and the gum was hard to chew It also started to get an off taste I was hoping it was going to be good I have tried the mints and there pretty good different but good I would agree with another reviewer that its like chewing on a piece of rubber
-1,I got these for my daughter who prefers chewy to crunchy  I generally love Kashi stuff but these were a disappointment  Even my daughter said yuck
1,Great taste and Anti BloatThis was recommended for relaxing and it does that tooA nice change from other Teas
-1,My wife and I have been drinking Senseo pods for years  We have always used the medium roast  On our last shipment we noticed the coffee tastes stale and old  Very nasty  The old pods have the sense logo on the pods themselves and these new pods do not so I dont know what that means but that seems to be the way to identify the bad tasting pods  These are so bad we cant even drink them  Im going to try one more order and if that tastes the same we may actually quit sense and move to Keurig  VERY disappointed in the new medium roast and I would not recommend as it tastes like coffee that is a week old
-1,There is really no added nutritional benefit to this product and to call it veggie pasta is seriously stretching the limits of credibility  I get it kids love Kraft mac  cheese  Heres I used to sneak veggies in to mac  cheese at the last minute I poured a handful of green peas in to the macaroni  Was it hidden Of course not but my kids grew up thinking that was how Kraft mac  cheese was  It was only the occasional visiting neighbor kid who ever protested
1,i so enjoy this soup and glad it can be purchased in a large amt progresso soup has really uped their game with such a variety of great soups one better than the next i love chicken rice soup and its very hard these days to find a good one wish i had some left today with the hurricane due to arrive tomorrow nothing like a good soup on a rainy day
-1,I wonder if anyone else has seen theSaturday Night Live sketch about a convention of pirates whose discourse is limited to thearrrgh sound  This product tastes like alfalfabarley juice except the popcorn texture makes it difficult to make the taste go away simply by holding your nose  As for all the health benefits the veggies indeed impart flavor to this mishmash a bag of which equals 8 grams of protein plus nearly 600 calories but what do the veggies contribute and what percentage of the product do they represent  Unless I notice some dramatic health benefits Im going to have trouble disposing of 12 bags Lesson Even though Amazon limits you to large quantities dont order 12 bags if you havent first tried one  The only way I can consume this stuff is to wash down every bite with a mouthful of cold Coke  Or picking up on the companys pirate theme Coke laced with a lot of rum  Unassisted by such complementary beverages Im afraid this booty elicits no pirates celebratory Arrrgh from me  Just plain Yuck is more like it
1,Since reading the other reviews I decided to try this extra virgin olive oil  It is subtle and delicious I keep it in conjunction with another that has a more pronounced olive flavor  But I cant say enough good things about this seller  The packaging is done so well I dont think anything could destroy the contents  And this is the fastest shipping ever  I will be visiting Super Olive just to see what else they carry because Id like to do more business with them
-1,I think Ive had this flavor theyre all so bland its hard to distinguish them Not to worry thoughthe portion is so small itll all be over soon Ive tried several flavors and theyre all forgettable I give up The people who love them must not get out much
-1,This product and company are AWFUL  I researched to make sure this product was GF and safe for our family with Celiac to ingest as a dietary supplement to help with leaky gut  I could only order a 6pack directly from the company but figured that was fine as this product gets such rave reviews  2 days into using 1 tsp a day per person in a hot lemonade drinkwe were SICK with glutening symptoms  Bad symptoms  Within 2 days of not ingesting this product we got better  Not to mention the taste and smell of the gelatin itself is absolutely DISGUSTINGIt literally tastes like eating smelly boiled shoes  I called the company to report our problems and the woman on the phone was extremely rude and belligerentinsisting that there was NO way the gelatin made us sick and perhaps my kitchen was just dirty  really  She would NOT refund my money unless I paid a 15 restocking feeeven though the product made us sick  The gelatin is made from boiled cow hides from Argentina and made in Argentina also  This product is horrible this company is horrible and I wouldnt even let my worst enemy eat this toxic garbage  I was SO angry after my phone conversation with this companyI cant even get myself to send the 6 cans back because I dont trust them  Perhaps I can sell them online myself
1,I usually dont compare down to this degree for something like this but since I had it both available I did a direct sidebyside taste test subjective at home with another brand offered by AmazonTraditional Medicinals Organic Roasted Dandelion Root 16Count Boxes Pack of 6 As for the Alvita brand my senses tell meSmell Good Same nutty aroma that resembles roasted tahini or peanut brittleColor Medium brown with some reddish tone Not as dark as Traditional MedicinalsTaste Good but not the best Ive tasted Initial flavor like some kind of nutty coffee drink is all there and good just not as rich There is also a very slight tang aftertasteDifferences aside this is a great healthy tea that supposedly promotes healthy liver function I started drinking this last time I got a caution that my liver enzymes were boderline high I have yet to confirm that it helped but the psychological benefits are helping a bit  It tastes good and somewhat resembles hot coffee in the morning only more healthierOn a comparitive note the tea bags themselves are cheap They do not have draw strings like most tea bags have they are not individually sealed or wrapped and they come grouped together in a nonresealing package If this doesnt effect you that much then I would recommend this buy because you get more tea bags for your money Otherwise I think you will get a better experience with Traditional Medicinals As a final tip with either brand the more you steep the more flavor comes out
1,I like Peppermint tea for helping out relieving my headaches and upset stomachs It seems to work well for me on both It is very relaxing as well and it taste great
1,For the hatersseriously  Protein bars never taste like real brownies or candy bars so I feel like the complainers are newbies to the proteinscene  If you find a decent one like this with this much protein you go with itI eat one of these every night I work nightshift cardiac nurse  Makes me feel full without making me tired from excess carbs Zero sugar in these good jobIncidentally I have had several types of the Think Thin bars and I think this one tastes the best  Not bad for a protein bar and even better with a big cup of coffee  Wish the chocolate flavor was a little stronger but not a deal breaker  I just bought another box
-1,This particular food item left a lot to be desired The powdered cheese left a very bad after taste I will not be purchasing this item again The only positive plug I shall give is that the serving size is generous
1,I love cinnamon    so Ive tried the mints and still have more to consume  When I run out Ill order more of the gum
-1,I am a vegetarian health food buyer for many years This product is not fresh Definitely stale I purchased for my classroom and have given them the same product before with no problem When purchasing from the product this time the taste is not fresh at all Extremely upset about the quality of this product when purchased this time I do not have money to waste and I know many others reading this do not have money to waste Do not buy it
-1,I usually love this coffee but for some reason the last box I purchased I had to return due to a strange chemical taste and odd odor that is not normally in this coffee  I was very sad because I love this coffee
-1,Special K Bars Vanilla Crisp 6  8 oz Bars  Pack of 12I ordered this item as an addition to my low calorie diet foods  I was extremely dissapointed in the fact that they have absolutely no taste and were very small I have eaten other low cal bars made by Special K which were good but the recipe for these should be discarded  I do not recommend this item to anyone who is looking for a low cal bar which also tastes good Kellogs you missed the boat with this one
1,I was just over raving at how much I despise Orvilles Natural popcorn Orville Redenbachers Gourmet Microwavable Popcorn Natural Simply Salted so I thought I should come over and say something nice about his kernels so people didnt think I was antiRedenbacherUnlike the Natural I really like the Tender White  Its nicely salted with a light fluffy texture  The first time we popped it I was surprised to find out that it really was more tender than Orvilles regular popcornThe downside is that you trade off fiber for tenderness  The Tender White you see has half the fiber of Ultimate Butter for example  And whats more surprising it has more fat Tender White has 13grams versus 11 grams for Ultimate Butter  You would think it would be viceversaTHE SKINNYExcellent tasty popcorn  I buy it sometimes but not all the time because my thighs tell me I dont need more than the 2 grams of fat I can get inOrville Redenbachers Gourmet Microwavable Popcorn Smart Pop 94 Fat FreePam Tmombloggerpopcorn muncher
-1,The gum tastes OK  But 1 for a single piece of gum is not reasonable
-1,I bought this took it home and read the ingredients and saw SUCRALOSE EWWWWWWWW If I had read it at the store I wouldnt have bought it Either way I popped some anyways Its surprisingly good its not great though It has more negatives than positives The positives are that it has a sweet taste for sure nothing chemical or weird though Thats about it for the positives The negatives are that you need to eat a handful or the popcorn is bland if you eat it in small handfuls THEN it tastes sugary and sweet The popcorn is also cold coming right out of the microwave I think this is due to it not really having any coating like butter so it gets cold fastI like warm popcorn Its also really light and dryI like buttery popcorn All in all this popcorn is good tasting and I am really picky about this stuff and artificial sweeteners it doesnt taste fake or chemical to me Have you ever had a popcorn ball It tastes like a less sweet version I happen to love popcorn balls some people dontUPDATE I only ate 1 bag of this stuff Its gross I dont like it
1,I always keep this on hand to perk up everything from plain ramen noodles to tacos  It has just the right amount of heat  And unlike so many hot sauces that are all heat you can actually taste the flavor of the peppers and other ingredients in it
-1,Not only does this product have too much sugar to really be healthy but it also tastes like cardboard Nobody would eat these and I had to throw them away I tried to eat these twice myself just so they wouldnt go to waste but each time I took one bite and had to throw it away Its really pretty inedible
1,Just the right amount of spice spicy the texture of the noodles was great and it was delicious  I wish they were cheaper but our entire family loves these  My only problem is the amount of carbs and salt but at least the fat was a huge amount lower than packaged noodle soups  3g a bowl vs about 12g for many other brands  Ill buy these again  Great food storage item when you can get a deal on them
-1,Someone must have shaken the boxes violently while packing or shipping  12 or more of the crackers are broken which works out great if you like crumbled crackers in your soup or chili  For those of us who dont it is irritating to find only 12 the box usable
-1,I LOVE rice dishes including many of this brands Knorr offeringsI love the taco rice and the teriyaki rice dishes are my favoritesI like Brocolli cheese soup and I thought 34THIS IS GOING TO BE GREAT34BOY WAS I WRONG this was extremely bland Not much flavor at all This lookedAnd tasted like plain rice and vermicelli with tiny little bits of broccoli in itThere was no taste of cheese nor the color of cheddar of cheese about itIf you like broccoli cheddar keep looking because THIS ISNT IT
1,Being from the northwest one would think I would prefer a dark over roasted coffee leaves an after taste coffee but no I like a mild yet flavorable coffee and this Nantucket blend was perfect No lingering after taste Almost a light roastTo me light roast does not insinuate a weak coffee but a flavorable one A lightmed roast can be rich in flavor it just doesnt bite back
-1,The licorice tea was not for me and the fruit flavored ones tasted too blandI do love their Apple Cider tea especially in the colder months
-1,this is a bag of coconut chips  Seems obvious  But unless you toast coocnut its really just for a topping  This is a 1lb bag of coconut topping  That being said the quality of the chips were ok
1,My son absolutely loves Krafts Macaroni and Cheese but like a lot of moms I have mixed feelings about feeding it to him For one thing that dayglo orange color scares me and yet thats one of the things he loves best about it Ive tried other mac  cheese products  and making it from scratch  but if its not that vivid orange hes just not as happy Two of my other reservations involve the sodium level and the stuffs ultimate nutritional voidSo enter Kraft Macaroni and Cheese Vegi Original Using cauliflower in both the pasta and the sauce Kraft has managed to accomplish the very same thing Id been doing sneaking in veggies so I do feel better about this version The bright orange color is there so my son was happy too I hadnt told him I was trying anything new but judging by the way he wolfed down his meal this tastes the exact same Of course that still leaves my sodium concern and with 28 of the daily allowance in a prepared single serving theres still quite a bit of salt in hereThat said my husband  who does NOT like mac  cheese OR cauliflower  also polished off his plate In 14 years of marriage Ive never seen him do that So whatever Krafts up to its good and Im glad not to have to make two separate dinners anymoreTo sum upPROS1 A good dose of cauliflower in both the pasta and sauce2 Same easy to follow instructions as the regular stuff3 No noticeable change in taste or texture despite the cauliflower addition4 One less vegetable serving I have to sneak into a meal5 Same neon orange color as your kids are used toCONS1 Still using enriched flour rather than whole grain2 Still pretty high in sodium 28 daily allowance per serving3 Still that same neon orange color your kids are used to
1,Ive made my own extract several times but im out of stevia at the moment This is an excellent quality extract Theres almost no flavor other than the desired sweet Comes with a nice dropper Cant beat it for the value
1,I am trying to follow an organic and gluten free diet I also like to buy from reputable companies So it is hard to find products that meet my criteria But I found these bars that meet it and also taste great And on top of all I like the fact that the company donates a percentage of their profits
-1,I realize these are instant potatoes but in my humble opinion they pale in comparison to other instants like Idahoan Theyre extremely bland I even tried adding butter  milk and the texture is pasty About the only positives are that theyre cheap  quick
1,There are few gifts I like to recieve more than milk Whole milk too Thats the kind of milk that says that its real Its right Its whole I want that milk to sit there for years because thats what you do with milk Theres nothing better than milk  well except maybe radishes
-1,Had a craving out of the blue  Felt  tasted like I was chewing Slim Jim flavored paper  Even after I peeled the casing it chewed down to what seemed like a wad of paper  I dont remember this happening in the long ago past
1,If I jazz this up with my own seasonings and whatnot it greatly improves this very healthytasting snack  There are lots of good vegetable ingredients so once one acquires a taste it is a much better option than the cheese popcorn I tend to overindulge in
-1,I am sorry I bought a dozen The product tastes good the first time but then it becomes boring the second time And by the third preparation the smell all over the house becomes objectional I was hoping we would eat a box a week but the onion taste and smell is so strong it stinks up our whole house for the day when we prepare the itemI bought on a subscription order basis but cancelled because of the overly strong seasoningI also bought the Skillet Fries and am really sorry I did They have the same seasoning and just as strong I fixed half a box and after rehydrating tried to rinse off a lot of the season but it didnt workIt will take a year or more for us to get rid of these Probably give some to the postal workers homeless food collection at ThanksgivingI wrote the company regarding reducing the seasoning but have had no response as yet

1,Its wintertime and theres nothing better than a hot cup of tea on a cold winters day  Tazos Wild Sweet Orange has been a favorite tea of mine for almost 10 years now I first got a sip of Tazo when we lived in Portland OR and I learned from the natives that a hot cup of tea from a local vendor was better than a pair of gloves to keep you warm I still love Wild Sweet Orange especially with just a hint of cinnamon to pick up the flavor
1,This cocoa is good but I if you make the cocoa according to the label directions it comes out a little bitter  instead of the 2t cocoa and 1t sugar we do just the opposite 1 t cocoa to 2 t sugar and it comes out delicious
1,The peach flavor is great All time wonder snack for those who need something 34sweet34 and cant have the sugar Fill up a six cup bowl add a little nonfat cool whip to taste put on a chick flick    perfect night and no guilt in the morning LOL
-1,These just taste weird  I dont know how to describe it  I knew they wouldnt be like regular rice krispy bars but these feel weird with a clear sticky type of glaze  have a very odd rice  peanut butter taste They also have an aftertaste  My toddler ate half of one but hasnt asked for one since
-1,my kids like all of the flavors but chocolate  They say they just dont taste very good
1,Yes this is very expensive but it doesnt hurt me when I pay 20 bucks for a bottle The extract will make or break your recipe It doesnt matter what brand of flour butter eggs sugar you use but if the vanilla is cheap it will ruin your creation or make it taste cheap This is the best vanilla worth the price of saffron It will taste like vanilla and will make your house smell like vanilla no alcohol aftertaste However the price on Amazon varies so check your local prices before purchasing it You might not even save anything if you just walk into Zabars or any baking store
1,When I originally reviewed the 12pack of these they were 30 more expensive than elsewhere but now via subscription this is a better price than I can get at any store  They are as fresh or fresher than those bought in stores and each unit of four sixbar packages is sealed in heavyduty plastic  Delivery is prompt as well  I agree with the Leading consumer magazine that rated these to be the best of all granola bars  They have no cheap unhealthy ingredients  just stuff that tastes great and is good for us barring allergies
1,This goes great on baked or broiled fish and meats  Wish it was available in bulk size  You dont need any other seasoning when using this
1,These are very light and delicious crackers  They go well in soup or with cheese  My children love them
-1,It is quite salty  I think the ingredients should be more clearly listed for people who may have food sensitivitiesyeast extract is often just a fancy name for MSG
-1,I desperately wanted a good organic vanilla flavor This product provides a wonderful aroma I opened the bottle love the glass bottle  so tired of plastic and thought 34this will be great34 The first pound cake I made using it didnt seem to have the strong vanilla flavor I like for my cakes And then I tried it in coffee No significant flavor whatsoever I dont recommend it and I wont buy it again

-1,I started using this stevia about a year ago and was really impressed  I just finished my last bottle from the old formula and started this new one I had just ordered  YUK  It has an aftertaste like aspartame and I should know Ive used artificial sweeteners for 40 years  The only thing I would recommend about this product is for Nunaturals to change back to their old formula  Im already looking for a new brand to try and wont wait until I finish this one which was a waste of good money
1,I want the kids to have yummy healthy things  these areboth but they are also very hard  even after being in milkfor some time I am eating them as the kids have a hard timedoing so and I have simply ordered them the flakes by thiscompany instead Fine for big folks with lots of teeth  a bitdifficult for little ones with teeth coming in  great flavornot sugary junk and corn starch  very wholesomeRecommended with Reservations only because of texture
-1,I consume energy drinks on a daily basis For a few years I drank Rockstar For the past 2 years I have been making my own with Sodastream  I buy the diet energy because it is no calories and no sugar but plenty of caffeine I usually drink a full 1liter bottle first thing in the morning and I must admit I add more syrup than youre supposed to I use about 15 caps of syrup instead of 1 cap This doesnt make me race around but just gives me the nudge I need to get on with my day Sometimes ill make another half liter later on in the dayThis was my first time trying or even hearing of GURU and unfortunately I found them to be extremely ineffective I have drank 6 of them in the past 11 hours  and I took a 2 hour nap during those 11 hrs I felt no energy at all from them My last one of the 6 was about a half hour ago I feel nothing except a slight stomach ache most likely due to all of the sugarThe taste isnt bad It has a typical energy drink taste It has a little less carbonation than a coca cola would I like a lot of carbonation and that is something else that I am spoiled with with my sodastream I can put as much carbonation as I wantI dont mind drinking them as a regular drink but I wont be going to them specifically for energy It definitely was not worth all of those calories and all of the sugarThe product info here on the page is a bit misleading In one place it says 97mg of caffeine per 84oz  serving another place says 100mg but on the can it says 125mgMy sodastream claims 80mg caffeine per 8oz serving Maybe the 34natural34 caffeine in GURU is not as potentThe sodastream syrup also has some vitamin content   20 daily value of Vitamins B6 and B12 Niacin Folate Riboflavin and Biotin as well as 50 daily value of Vitamin C It may not mean much but I like having that vitamin content as I am a pickypoor eater and I need to consume them wherever I canThe can says not to mix with alcohol and I am wondering whyI wouldnt recommend these to someone who drinks energy drinks regularly and has a tolerance for caffeine because they are ineffective
1,OK so I cant tell if its making that much of a difference as far as milk production goes  Ive done pretty well regardless but have tried both this tea as well as the Traditional Medicine version and havent noticed a difference between the twoI dont really have a reason to be paranoid but I tried the teas to halp build up my freezer stopck of milk in case I have any issues with production and need a good supply of backup  As a result Ive tried the teas and brewers yeast pills  I didnt see a significant increase but they have served as a security blanket of sorts for me However I wanted to put this review up because so many of the others talk about how tasty the Yogi version is I just wanted to say that I think the Traditional Medicines and Yogi tea versions taste almost exactly the same so go with whichever you find the best deal on
1,I use this gelatin every day for making my own jello and fruit snacks  I also mix this in with a cup of tea for joint health  No problems melts right in
-1,I gave this one star because of the price and the fact that the pouch it come in is not resealable I found and bought a 1 pound resealable bag on Amazon for 16 dollars vs just 4 ounces here for 11 I wish I had of researched more before my purchase of this Look before you leap
-1,I dont like this product I love pasta salad and Im not picky at all but this pasta salad is very bland and tastes like nothing except for oregano I even used olive oil instead of vegetable like other people here said to do I dont know why this very bland product is getting rave reviews
-1,I was so disappointed that these crackers came crumbled  It would have been nice to get an entire cookie  The taste is okay but a bit bland  But I took one of the packets and ate all the crumbs I do appreciate that they are separately packaged however in pecies Why cannot they pack them so they dont fall apart  Going to send them back
1,this granola tastes really great and it is high in protein which I like I add it to my plain greek yoghurtwhat I dont like about this granola is the high sugar content only 14 cup is already 1 serving so you have to be careful when comparing it to other granolas because some of the other brands use 34cup as 1 servingI can highly recommend but be sure to measure the serving size because it is really easy to eat 2 or 3 times the serving size and then it is not healthy at all
-1,Short and Sweet  this beef jerky is quite sweet compared to commercial jerky  In a one ounce portion there are seven 7 grams of carbohydrates  For those on a lowcarb diet that is a significant amountI notice that in the more natural jerkies they tend to use more sugar  Perhaps it helps the texture and make the jerky a little less likely to dry outIt does show this on the label which Amazon makes available so dont make the same mistake I did and buy impulsivelyIf you are trying to find a beef jerky without preservatives and from animals raised without antibiotics etc then this product is acceptable if a little sweet  But if you are on a high protein diet avoiding carbohydrates then beware
1,I was having trouble winding down at night so I shopped around and found this Yogi Bedtime tea I loved it right off the bat because it smelled so wonderful I was surprised by the licorice flavor because it wasnt overpowering at all It was ever so mild in the back of my throat Overall the flavor was delicate and smooth Although this didnt help me fall asleep it was still a good tea that helped me relax and calm down after a long day
1,I have switched to a low fat diet all kinds of fat I get 1 eating right broccoli slaw package canola oilin my scanpan garlic ginger paste  onions optional pour in the contents broccoli cabbage carrots or similar loads of veggies to choosethen oyster sauce and low sodium soy sauce a teaspoon of each per 2 cups of veggies stir fry for 10 minutes max and voila Chinese veggies Drop a few drops of rice wine vinegar and pull the noodles out of the micowave 7minutes on high in my Fastapasta and Dinner for 2 or 2 nites Sriracha sauce optional All done in 15 minutes 0000 saturated fat and delicous
1,I love this tea Spicy sweet  If your first pick in the chocolate aisle is the one with the hottest chili nibs this is your nocalorie alternativeHowever we must talk about the price on Amazon  Im searching the site because I first encountered the tea while on vacation in New York City  Fairway carries it for about half the price of listed here
1,I was looking for a hulless popcorn due to my diverticulitis boy do I miss popcorn and tried this based on the reviews I was disappointed that this has way to many hulls for ME the hulls do not disappear or get so small but the flavor of the popcorn is amazing very very tasty my family loves it so I will buy it again  We air popped it sprayed it with a little cooking oil and sprinkled some popcorn flavored seasoning butter  Hardly any calories but lots of taste  They are tiny when they pop so you really should not flood it with anything heavy or it will turn to mush
-1,I have no doubt that its very good But I bought the same package at GFS Foods for three bucks
-1,I ORDERED THESE CANDIES AND OF COURSE I WAS EXCITED BECAUSE I LOVE GINGER CANDIESBUT I FOUND THEM AT LEAST FIVE6SIX LOCAL STORES FOR WAY LESS THAT I PAID FOR THEM ON THIS SITEI WILL CERTAINLY DO MY PRICECHECK LOCALLY FOR CERTAIN ITEMS BEFORE I PURCHASE THEM ONLINE
-1,This stuff tastes like mushrooms to me and I hate mushrooms partially allergic I assume its the soy based product coming out in it since its vegan and doesnt use any other source of protein I gave it an extra star bumped up from 1 star since it does provide protein and thats essentially what I wanted I ended up returning it since it tastes horrible
-1,136 for 12 boxesIs this a rare itemThats 1133 a boxI think the item might be a bit overpriced
-1,Althouh I love Senseo coffees for the most part I didnt care for this one at all  It has a smokey burnt flavor to me that tastes like coffee thats been sitting out for hours  Plus I had the same problems others mentioned with torn pods that contaminated the rest of the bag and what a mess that was  I wont be buying this kind again
1,All I can say is try this wonderful tea  On a quiet fall winter spring afternoon a hot cup of this tea with the aroma floating through the room relaxes and changes the mood of the entire day to a curl up on the couch with some good music and open the window take in some fresh air and smile Goes great with cookies or eggs and cheese or just your pajamas or sweats and a comfy chair  This is the tea to take a break with or take a walk in the park with  Enjoy
1,Very impressed with the different cheese and how wonderful they tasted  I would order this and others as well  Thanks
-1,I bought this with serveral other teas because soda has gotten too expensive  We make tea by the gallon and then put them in the frig  This saves a lot of money as there are 9 people in our household  This tea does have a very nice flavor but you have to hunt for it Allinall I will not buy it again because it is just too weak
-1,Yuck  This bar tastes like chalk and nonfood bulk with the slightest hint of chemicalladen chocolate  Theres no way I could get all the way through this thing  In the event that you are able to eat the whole thing Im sure its quite filling as its a very heavy dense bar  That said I think the box it came in had better texture and flavor than this thing  This is only food in the loosest possible sense of the term
1,I get this all the time at the store and sprinkle them in my yogurt protein shakes on ice cream and in my omelets They are a good source of fiber and other nutrients I would suggest them for anyone
-1,This jerky sounded pretty promisingIt has a great price and they use quality beef and no chemicalsWhen I got it however I was very underwhelmed by the flavor  It was too sweet and not spicy enough  Also when I got done chewing on a bunch of it I would have a wad of unchewable fatty junk in my mouth which I had to spit outProsThey use quality beef with no growth hormones or antibioticsNone of the chemicals that are in a lot of jerkyTexture was good but not greatGood priceConsNot very spicySugar is the second ingredient making it way too sweet and not as healthy as it could beBeef cuts a little too fattyI would definitely not buy this flavor again and I would probably keep looking before considering another bag of Golden Valley Jerky
-1,Now please bear in mind that taste is highly subjective and just because I did not like this fruitcake  and Im a fruitcake lover  doesnt mean that you or someone else might not enjoy it  Here are the reasons I didnt like it  I like pecans or even walnuts in fruitcake and this recipe uses almonds  The almonds added nothing to the taste and the texture was obtrusive  In the middle of a bite of fruitcake there is a rather hard chewy almond to deal with  Not pleasant  And there were a lot of almonds  The ironic thing is that this fruitcake is made in Georgia and I believe Georgia grows pecans my favorite  Next I found the cake to be rather dry compared to other fruitcakes  And last of all I have to agree with my friend who said 34it seems to be missing something34  Maybe the something missing is the alcoholic beverage flavoring most fruitcakes I dont know  Anyway I love fruitcakes but I will not order this one again
1,I use this on Mexican dishes rice beans etc  I am a huge fan of Habanero sauces and this green sauce takes the cake  I havent found anything similar in quality or spiciness  Highly recommend if it if you enjoy a nice hot green sauce
-1,I was really happy to see this coffee for such a great price I even got a better price using the additional Senseo coupon codeAs soon as I got the pods I brewed my first cup of    the weakest coffee ever except for when I forgot to add the coffee to the coffee maker I was really disappointedAfter reading the package I discovered I could use two pods to improve the flavor Of course this also doubled the price making the deal not so good after all Using two pods was a little too strong for my taste Senseo rates the coffee as between mild and med It was VERY VERY mildIn all fairness to this product I purchased these pods to use with my EZCup in my Keurig So perhaps they would make better tasting coffee in the Senseo pod coffee maker
-1,As an avid vegetarian cook and cookbook author I use a lot of different herbs and spices But sometimes I do like the convenience of a basic allpurpose seasoning blendI tried Bragg Organic Sprinkle Seasoning recently and had hoped it would be a good alternative to the nonorganic basic seasoning blends that are available ie Mrs Dash etc Unfortunately having rosemary as the dominant first ingredient is not a good choice It overpowers the rest of the ingredients that are included in this mixI plan to transition to making my own organic seasoning blends very soon having found a good supplier for organic herbsspices recentlyThis is not a seasoning blend I would buy again or recommendGeraldine Helen Hartman author of The Groovy Green Kitchen and Not Just for Vegetarians
1,I ordered these to try them because I heard they were really good They arrived in about a week and I ate one It was such a different experience than eating any other chocolate bar I had tried It was soo good I will be ordering again soon
-1,I tried cocoa dusted chocolate truffles once and they were magnificent  I dont remember the brand but I was hoping these would be just as good  Unfortunately these are really mediocre  There is no luscious chocolate flavorvery bland  Even my 12 year old who loves chocolate said these were just okayIll have to continue my search for delicious chocolate truffles elsewhere
-1,I have some digestive issues and this tea did not do trick A little disappointed Dont waste your money on it  Tastes so so
-1,I dont know what the deal is but these small bottles dont taste goodThe Larger size is a much better optionYou can always fill the small container whenneededGot a 18oz from Amazon and it has much better flavor
1,I live in a family with 2 very small children and so the ultra spicy foods that I like are not on the menu here  When we make soups stews and chili it is always made pretty mild so that little girls wont end up crying  Unfortunately I like my chili hot enough to give me a case of the hiccups so I find life kind of dull when mealtime comes aroundThats where dried Diced Jalapenos come in  I love having a bottle of this on hand so that when dinner is served up I can add some ZIP to my own plate without endangering young palettes  Everybody is happy The little ones are curious but they arent forced to eat food that they arent ready forI wouldnt be without my McCormicks Diced Jalapeno Peppers but they are not always available at the store  I was happy to find them here
1,This natural very healthy sweetener is absolutely delicious in my morning English breakfast tea  It doesnt have the  awful  off taste many alternative sweeteners  have It is a great product  I read it even helps with blood pressure issues  
-1,I was really looking forward to microwavable mac  cheese but this tasted so bitter and horrible I checked the date to use by and it was far in the future I tried another packet on another day in case it was a fluke but the same vile taste was present I discarded the rest of the box My guess is that something was wrong with the whole package and its probably not common but just in case I will not be ordering this again
1,A very rich taste especially with the foam at the top I almost became addicted to this coffee I was drinking way too much caffeine But the flavor is fabulous with lots of body I have now just talked myself into having a cupEW
1,I discovered Recaito while in Puerto Rico on vacation  They use it in many Puerto Rican dishes  We use it in every Kale dish we ever make and there are many kale dishes that we make  This stuff is awesome  We also use it in stir fry stews soups dishes that contain vegetables dishes that contains ham pork or chicken dishes that contain beansricepeas  It is just versatile  it adds a bangpunch of wonderful flavors to any ordinary dish even casseroles  If you like cilantro you will LOVE this  We keep Recaito well stocked in our pantry and use it all of the time  I highly recommend
-1,I was expecting something a little softer like actual honeycomb  Whatever the center was made of was hard as rocks so either it was super stale or not at all honeycomb  The chocolate covering was soso  Overall these were pretty meh
-1,REally wanted to like this but it has no taste  Now I am stuck with 4 canisters
1,Works great when taken at night before bed and doesnt hurt the tummy Ive been taking this for years and always buy it at amazon
1,This product is very good and extremely easy to prepare The taste is very authentic  I will continue to reorder this
1,An essential for Asian cooking I have also used it on broiled steaks as cooked on the Hibatchi or grill Arrived carefully packed in a secure box This is the best
1,I was looking for something with lots of pieces and a reasonable price since we have gaggles of kids coming around on Halloween  Well these turned out to be perfect  We didnt run out and one of the moms even asked for some since they were her favorites  Will be back next year for more
1,My favorite granola bars ive tried so many If mocha is a flavor that you like and you prefer them to be chewy with almonds then go for itPlus theyre mostly healthy and relatively affordable on Amazon They make a great snack for myself that is
-1,We usually eat the cup version from Kraft I got tired of always watching the sales at my local store and rushing out to buy them so I ordered these First of all these are not the cups There is a plastic pouch with noodles and a paper pouch with powder You have to use your own bowl Not really a big dealThe weird thing is they tasted funny Not quite as cheesy Really they tasted stale My 3 yo wont eat them My husband and I both tried them and agreed they are off We threw them out Waste of money
1,I was amazed when I opened the first package of this Turkey JerkyI used to buy the exact same item at Whole Foods but they were out before my last backcountry trip so I got it from Amazoncom and wow I could believe how tender the jerky was nothing like when I got it from Whole FoodsIt might just be a quirk and I cant test for a while since it will take a year to get through 6 packages
-1,I searched for a yogurt starter on Amazon and this product came up as an optionWhen I received it there was a sticker not to be used as starterAmazon did agree to take back the unopened bag I dont know what to do with the remainderof the open one
-1,The thinkThin chocolate fudge protein bar is a very underwhelming protein bar  Boasting 20g of protein the bar also has 8g of fat 3 of which are saturated with 240 calories  For that you might as well have a Luna Protein Bar which is chocolatey hearty hefty filling and extremely tasty  This bar is none of those thingsThe initial bite is reminiscent of a lackluster Three Musketeers bar The chocolate has a chalky Play Doh taste to it  Another bite you notice the slightly meaty flavor of the protein this is a problem from which most high protein bars suffer  More bitesI honestly cant say  Its taken me almost a week to eat the whole thing  It doesnt feel substantial yet you definitely arent in the mood for more after a bite or twoBottom line you want a lot of protein and you dont care what it tastes like go for it  If taste and consistency are concerns look elsewhere like the Luna Protein bars
-1,I WANTED to love this tea  It was SAD  I gave it away  On the other hand I ADORE the Harney  Sons Chocolate Mint loose tea  it is FABULOUS
-1,I wanted to like the three flavors of these I orderedbut I just cannot enjoy them They taste nothing like the fine Indian food I enjoy eating out In fact the after taste reminds me of any food that is old Will not order again Two stars because they tried
1,I enjoy many teas and Kava is one of my favorites  It has a pleasant taste and it actually sweet so you dont need to add anything to it  It does have a nice calming effect which is also nice at times
1,I love the keurig format of coffee  Now and all the other flavors it is less messy and great  flavor is a refreashing taste
-1,Up Front I did not buy this product on Amazon but still wanted to let people know  I purchased a 17 oz bottle of Kikkoman AjiMirin last night at a supermarket for 499  I tasted it when I got home  Wasnt too impressed  I think Id prefer using my rice wine vinegar and adding a little sugar to it
1,I bought this product for one reason only to accompany my grilled cheese sandwichesFor me regular cans of soup just have way too much soup for a meal with one grilled cheese sandwich but not quite enough to split in half and still have a satisfying amount  The soup at hand servings are perfect  The taste is creamy the consistency is smoothit pretty delicious for something that comes in a canDownsides For a small container of soup it sure packs a punch of your suggested daily sodium intake 30 and it has more calories than I expected 190 cals  In the future I would rather get the classic tomato soup and make it creamy on my own by adding a dollop of sour cream or better yet greek yogurt for a much lower calorie but still creamy tomato soup
-1,This is the most disgusting coconut water Ive ever had It is brown and tastes rotted I buy the 34ONE34 brand as well and that one comes out of the package a clear color with very slightly white tint If you pour a glass of this next to the other one the difference is shocking Zicos is a very noticeable brown color and tastes of rotting plant materialI called amazon about the first package I received and they sent me a new one  also brown and disgusting I will not buy any more of this EVER
-1,Really bought this coffee to brew at a larger size  10 oz  instead of the usual 8 oz size for a bigger cup of coffee Still too strong and bitter tasting at a larger size brew
1,Slate Magazine has a review on table salts and this was the winner  So I ordered some from Amazon and compared it myself to the brands available where I live including Celtic Sea Salt  There is no comparison Maldon is the standout winner It is big flaky crunchy pieces of very tasty salt  This is not a baking salt  It is more of a finishing salt to go on foods  Its wonderful on avocado steamed yellow squash baked potatoes etc  The Slate reviewer said he loved it the best on chocolate HaumlagenDazs ice cream  Its that good
1,Salt is pretty much salt Its just a little too big for my salt grinder but I make it work
-1,Normally I could buy these types of noodles at NYCs Chinatown for a dollar a pop but Ive been getting lazy and tried testing these Annie Chun bowls when they showed up at my local supermarket two weeks agoAs it stands the noodles and vegetables themselves arent bad at all However the socalled teriyaki sauce is terrible First it doesnt taste like teriyaki Secondly the sauce kind of tastes like watered down ketchup If youve ever actually added ketchup to your ramen noodles youll know what I mean Its that slightly tangy slightly sweet taste you get when you havent yet put enough ketchup or seasoning to taste Needless to say I felt gypped It was like I had paid three bucks for some basic Japanese noodles in a ketchup sauceSo needless to say I would pass on these bowls Youre better off gettingMyojo Udon Noodle Soup Mix Beef 722Ounce Packages Pack of 30 No these dont come in fancy cardboard packaging or a thick plastic bowl youll bever use again but theyre much cheaper and taste great so whats the difference
1,Bought these to make truffles but I couldnt get my husband to stop eating them 
1,I really love the convenience of having automatic shipments and signing up for this service enabled me to get a great price as well  It is terribly hard to find coffee pods in any of the grocery stores anymore and decaf is next to impossible to find  Thank you Amazoncom for providing the product Ive been looking for
1,If I didnt know better Id think I cooked and mashed them by myself I thought Id need to add something to them  like butter sour cream cream cheese or something  but no these are good to goI make one envelope and it makes enough for four meals for me Love it Hm I wonder if I could add chocolate and create a dessert Nah I love potatoes and these are the best
-1,I found this product to be tasteless Even a dollar store product has more flavor than this does Iwould never buy this brand again and would not recomend it to anyone
-1,I just received my package of Stevita Supreme stevia sweetener It is the most repulsive tasting sweetener I have ever used Im sure saccharine is better tasting than this stuff I did a side my side comparison of Stevita aspartame and Splenda The aspartame and Splenda are both decent tasting and the Stevita is HORRIBLE Bitter and tasting of some sort of chemicalThankgod it was only  bucks with free delivery because its probably going in the trash or to a soup kitchen  though the homeless certainly deserve better than this stuff
1,The pediatrician had me use Enfamil AR with my daughter because she was small and spit up so much  I8217m not a fan of adding rice cereal to a bottle to thicken formula  It regularly clogged the nipple and I had guilt over force feeding her cereal  Essentially it was like 8220If you want your bottle you WILL eat this rice cereal too8221  Yes I know this is my issue and not really the norm  I was very pleased with the Enfamil ARPros It didn8217t clog the nipples of the bottles and I didn8217t have the guilt I guess because the rice was already added I love the idea of buying one plastic canister and then refill packs  I recycle but would prefer less waste upfront  Why did companies not think of this sooner Formula mixed well and I had no issues with the powderCons It didn8217t really help with her spitting up but I think this is just my child  Nothing seems to help with the spitting up
1,My husband is always hassling me to eat something good with protein as I am a carb lover  These white meat chunk chicken in cans are great because Im terrible at meal planning  All of a sudden Ill be hungry NOW with no time to cookSo I open a can of this Swanson chicken drain it dump it into a tupperware add a couple heaping tablespoons of lite Miracle Whip and start mashing at the chunks with a fork  I scoop up the newly made chicken salad with saltine Ritz or butter club crackers  Tada instant proteinfilled meal  This chicken would be great for serving to kids too  I ALWAYS have cans of this in my cupboards  I can add some more flavor by adding ground black pepper mustard relish and other kitchen staplesIt is cheaper at my local stores  But if you cant get out to the store Ive always had great service from amazon
-1,Although Zico may claim to be natural I disagree since it is made from concentrate I prefer to drink Vita Coco which is a much more flavorful brand of coconut water and is actually 100 NATURAL
-1,First I have to say that I love Yogi tea I love the messages on the tea bags and some flavors are remarkable This one however is horrible I guess if you love licorice root you will like it but I do not I tolerate the licorice flavor in the CALM Yogi tea because it really calms me before bed and makes me feel like I am floating on a cloud but it still manages to taste good whereas this one does notPlease do buy Yogi tea and get the Green Tea Slim Life instead terrific taste which tastes like green tea with berries in it a good flavor and not an artificial flavor to it This Fasting tea has a bitter after taste which is all licorice root Stay clear of this flavor but do buy Yogi Tea I feel transformed by the messages on the tea bags as it is so profoundWise quotes from Yogi Tea by Yogi BhajanThe universe is the stage on which you dance guided by your heartThe purpose of life is to enjoy every momentDelight the world with compassion kindness and graceLaugh because that is your purpose in lifeHappiness is every human beings birthright Be happy so long as breath is in youReal happiness lies in that which never comes nor goes but simply isTravel light live light spread the light be the lightPractice kindness mercy and forgivenessBliss cannot be disturbed by gain or lossCompassion has no limit Kindness has no enemy There is no love without compassionAppreciate yourself and honor your soul Love your soulGrace brings trust appreciation love and compassionBe proud of who you are There is nothing more precious than the selfLove is where compassion prevails and kindness rulesAn attitude of gratitude brings opportunitiesRecognize that the other is youLife is a flow of love your participation is requestedWhere there is love there is no question Your greatest strength is loveThe best way to live is to be simply beWhen you know that all is light you are enlightenedYour head must bow to your heartYour greatness is not what you have its what you giveFall in love stay in love and it will decide everythingAll that is needed is surrender and gratitudeTo be calm is the highest achievement of the selfMay this day bring you peace tranquility and harmonyOld age needs wisdom and graceUnderstanding is found through compassionLove compassion and kindness are anchors in lifeInspiring others towards happiness brings you happiness
1,I am on a lowcal diet so this product appealed to me since I drink coffee The flavor is great very chocolatey to say the least It turns most any coffee into hot chocolate
1,If youre cooking with tomatoes using packaged is actually a good move  Theyre usually really flavorful which cant always be said about the fresh that are available most places  Pomi tomatoes are really excellent some of the best Ive ever tasted and the packaging is BPAfree which no canned tomatoes currently on the market can boast  Quite simply this is one of the best choices you can make for cooking tomatoes
-1,I was looking for a strong ginger tea and purchased the Yogi brand based on its reputation I am certain Yogi offers many delicious teas however I just dont like the taste of this one It tastes of licorice and just feels murky in my mouth I have a hard time getting it down and cant taste the ginger unless I let the bag sit in the cup for a long period of time The spicy kick of ginger I sought was totally lacking Unfortunately I purchased two boxes at a time Its going to take a while to get it all down but I guess I will eventually do soUpdate 51713  Generally I drink my teas unsweetened which resulted in my atrocious experiences with this particular tea Since I had such a good quantity in supply and couldnt bear to throw it all away I made a cup today sweetened with Splenda That made a mountain of difference I still wont say it is my favorite tea but the sweetness took the disgusting edge off what I found initially unpalatable and nauseating Although it was my intent to steer clear of artificial sweeteners its whats available at work Now I can give the tea an extra star
1,Anyone who loves macncheese has tried some type of brand of shellsncheese The only difference is the shape of the pasta It became a huge hit with kids because it is so cheesyThen various companies decided to use real cheese spreads usually with some sort of plastic or foil pouch encloused These caught on quickly for good reason Not only can consumers see that they are getting in most cases real cheese but consumers feel that they are making the dish healther for the familyWhether that is true or not depends mainly on WHICH brand you used The more expensive the brand does not always mean more healthy Let us face it many powders are just as good tasting and as healthy for your family as the squeeze It was psychological It workedThen came microwave macncheese This quickly became a busy parents dream However it is not much faster than stove top Perhaps 4 minutes But when people think of microwaves they think fast So this is currently the new craze Not much faster and still bowls to wash You usually get LESS pasta this way too even though you are paying just a little bit more than normal for what you think is convenientKRAFT advertises more than most brands so shoppers are more apt to pick up the KRAFT brand Think about it How many ads do you recall seeing about ANNIES HOMEGROWN Personally I do not recall a single one Therefore most people totally ignore this brandBad move If you check out the box this brand is actually better for you yes more healthy for you than KRAFT Cost is about the same as wellBut this comes with a little twist ANNIES HOMEGROWN encloses WHITE cheddar for a slightly different taste Yes there are a few other white cheddar brands out there but again check the box This one really is healthier for youSo before you pick up the store generic or any other brand you might want to take just a little time to read the package You will find this one more impressiveReviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews
-1,Really the chocolate flavor is kind of gross and there are little particles of stuff floating around in the liquid Gross
1,I am one of those people who when they get a bad cold it eventually settles into the chest in a very bad way family genes and each time it takes longer and longer to really lose the cough and congestion Last weekend the latest cold making the rounds hit me and head sorely congested I spotted this on the grocery shelves and decided to give it a shot While it isnt the greatest tasting tea ever my head did clear up enough so that I passed on the cold medicine for the night and the cold had pretty much cleared up the next morning and virtually no chest congestion at all
1,This is an excellent product The honey is smooth and tasty and if there is a drawback it is that the honey is solid  not crystallized but more like smooth butter I really didnt mind so for me it was everything I was looking for The price was reasonable the packaging adequate and delivered on time
1,These remind me of my childhood when Nabisco Ritz Crackers were a favorite treatpackaged well fresh tasting and high quality just what I was craving
-1,I have bought the version in the boxes before but thought the plastic bottles would be more convenient  Unfortunately it makes the drink taste like plastic  The plastic taste is very strong and awful  Stick to the boxed type
1,This is my husbands favorite cereal and this is a Great price and we just keep the extra boxes in the basement
-1,Twinkies were once great but once they sold out to the big corporation the quality went down the drain Its too artificial tasting to be considered food There are a ton of chemicals and additives added You call this cake
-1,I used to be a Tabasco fan  I really didBut after branching out and trying other sauces I cant help but see how flawed it is  And I think its popularity is due not to its quality but due to it being a recognizable brandThe quality shockingly isnt as high as you might think  In fact I find it to be quite lowquality  After sampling many other sauces in the past few months Im going through a hotsauce kick lately Tabasco in retrospect comes off as quite cheaptasting and with no real flavor  And the burn isnt natural  It tastes chemically  Mainly due to the fact that all you taste is vinegar  And to me thats not the mark of a good sauce  A good sauce should have a natural burn moreso like fire or radiating heat and a nice flavor to it  It shouldnt taste too vinegary and it definitely shouldnt have an artificialfeeling chemically burn  But thats what Tabasco really tastes like when I really pay attention and analyze itJust to make my analysis more fair and uptodate tonight I decided to do a tastetest with it and some of the others sauces I had on hand  I used about six different sauces in comparable amounts  Straight to the tongue  With a cool down period in between so I could clear my mouth out of the burn and flavor  And classic Tabasco was the worst in terms of flavor  I hate to say that because I know its popular due to its recognizable nature  But it was the worst by far  To the point I almost just tossed the whole bottle in the trash because I dont see myself using it ever  I didnt since I figured I should have it onhand for friends who may want some  But I definitely wont be using it againIm quite saddened by how poorly classic Tabasco holds up  But dont get me wrong  I do like some of their other available flavors a little bit  I think their Chipotle sauce is ok because it at least has a slight touch of flavor though again its far too vinegary for its own good  But classic Tabasco is just very poor in retrospectLow quality  No real flavor  Gross chemically burn  Id say branch out and try something new instead of going with the sameold Tabasco
-1,Years ago I wrote a review singing the praises of Smooth Move which Id drunk for years But two different doctors told me it probably wasnt a good idea to drink it One reason is that it stains your colon So when you have a colonoscopy its more difficult for the doctor to see whats going on in there Also its a stimulant laxative which can cause problems with regular use I now take Miralax which works perfectly and the doctor says I can take as much of that as I want
-1,This Thanksgiving I went to my sisters she made gravy with Zanthan Gum  Shortly after sampling the gravy I had a severe toxic reaction my face looked like a puffer fish my heart was racing vertigo my tongue started to swell  I developed sepsis and my lungs partially collapsedThe packaging does not provide any guidance or black box warning as it should about the severe toxicity if used in quantities greater than 5 of total volume of food or liquid  The manufacturer is negligent and even deceptive in marketing this manufactured product as if it were all naturalXanthan gum is a largely indigestible polysaccharide that is produced by bacteria called Xanthomonas Camestris  Manufacturers place the bacteria in a growth medium that contains sugars and other nutrients and the resulting product of bacterial fermentation is purified dried powdered and sold as xanthan gum Makes you wonder who first thought to put it in food doesnt itIn other words xanthan gum is an industrial processed product  It is a polysaccharide produced by a biotechnological fermentation processa chemical There is nothing natural about xanthan gumCertainly never mix or serve to small children until the dangers are fully explained by the FDAs ongoing investigations Currently there are ongoing lawsuits as a result of Xanthan Gum being added to baby formula to thicken it the babies intestines developed holes and collapsed resulting in deathsFDA has issued new cautions and studies as to this food additives safety It certainly should not be sold in bulk giving the appearance that it is a flour of some type very misleading and possibly deadly  Well likely all hear more soon on this issue  just be cautious and know what and how much you are putting into your food and body  or your familysOne lesserknown use of xanthan gum is in the oil industry As a thickener it can be added to drilling fluid or drilling mud to improve its function Drilling fluid serves several purposes including cooling the drill bit providing hydrostatic pressure and helping to lift solids out of the borehole and keeping those solids in suspension when drilling stopsGlutenfree is not the same food just without Gluten something else is added in its place  FInd out what and how safe it it is  better yet just avoid any foods with Gluten if you do have Celiacs disease  Shortcuts are rarely quite as simple as them may seem in my experience
1,just a word of advice to those of you who are considering BULK ORDERING this productit does NOT store well if you order more than you can use in a few SHORT months make sure that you have a DRY and preferably vacuumsealed environment in which to store the unused portioni bought a couple of lbs of powder and used it a couple of timesstored the extra lbs in a kitchen cabinet in their original packagingmonths later the UNOPENED bags of powder were as hard as rocks
1,Pretty close to a great mix of sweet  salty I really like it for road trips Try some now
-1,Kellogg agreed to remove 8220all natural8221 labeling from its line of Kashi and Bear Naked products which the lawsuit claimed contain several artificial ingredients In addition theyre setting aside 5 million in a fund to dole out 50cent refunds to Kashi customers and 325000 for Bear Naked customers They do not seem to disclose all ingredients and after further research apparently Kashi is owned by Kellogg and donated some 790700 dollars to defeat prop 37 GM labelling in CA The question is why wouldnt they want me to know the exact ingredients after all I am paying for the product
-1,I purchased these on Amazon based on the nutrition information provided It is a LIE The packaging states 1 serving per package 290 calories 970 mg sodium Thats a lot of sodium The nutrition information on this website states 140 calories and 470 mg sodium for one serving If that were the actual case I might actually try the soup Now I will never know if the soup actally TASTES good or not since it has proved to be A VERY UNHEALTHY CHOICE Please provide ACCURATE AND ACTUAL information so your customers can make INFORMED decisions Waste of my time and money The ACTUAL NUTRITION FACTS from the side of the carton are Calories 210 total fat 15g Sodium 970mg Total carbs 59g dietary fiber 2g sugars 4g protien 11g As you can see you are consuming about half a days sodium and depending on your diet a lot of carbs with very little nutritional value Had this information been available on Amazon I would have purchased something else for my workday lunches
1,Being on a highprotein low carb diet I really missed bread  Having found a recipie for lowcarb bread I  found that Vital Wheat Gluten is almost impossible to find locally and as usual an Amazon merchant came through  I am so pleased with Honeyville and got it at a lower price than what I did find in a local health food store
1,Im a bit of a hardcore chilehead and Ive tried many hot sauces most are far hotter than Cholulas original  But Cholulas original while mild by my standards is an exceptionally great tasting hot sauce  And my 8 year old son also agrees so I make sure to keep some in stock for him too even if Im using something much hotterThis is probably the best hot sauce that you can buy in a supermarket
-1,Miracle Whip 18Ounce Bottles Pack of 12 is one sweet obnoxious product I have ever encountered From what I hear people either loves it or hates it I am in the latter category Even if I was on a deserted island and this product was the only one available to accompany be that a fish freshly caught a salad made of the abundant vegetation this island would offer a loaf of bread that unexpectedly drifted towards the shore in a waterproof container Miracle Whip is a resounding NO And now the commercials try to make it look like the rebel of mayos the one who did not played by the rules Way too sweet to be anything other than a disastrous addition to any course served in my table 1 Star since 0 is not available
-1,These taste like instant coffee with skim milk  I much prefer Senseo Dark Roast with half and half stirred while it is making  It makes an excellent cappuccino or latte  These pods taste artificial and puny
-1,Stale as all get out Do not buy Learn from my bad Do not waste your money Gag Ack  Barf
1,With clear gel you can make your own instant puddings  You can also use this product to add to a cake or cake mix that doesnt contain pudding its pudding without the flavor  Works great to make your cakes moist and tender  Instructions on the site and recipes
-1,Its just a cookieand quite a fattening one at that  One 176ounce pouch of Cinnamania Cinnamon Buns comes in at a whopping 230 calories with a significant 30 from fat The contents consist of several small graham crackertype cookies with a white sugar glaze to simulate rather halfheartedly the look of a cinnamon bun The consistency however perhaps due to the enriched wheat flour is anything but and a pale imitation of what you would buy at a Starbucks or bake from a Pillsbury rollup packageIn fact the weaklynamed Cinnamania is more akin to something from Mothers Cookies the kind of unmemorable confection you would find in one of those big bags you get at discount on Costco The flavor is not bad just undistinguished considering how it has been positioned as a proxy for a freshlybaked bun The package exclaims that its a Good Source of Calcium and 4 Vitamins but it hardly warrants an endorsement for its questionable nutritional value If you have a need for a cinnamon bun then I suggest you go to your nearest Cinnabon in order to justify the calorie intake
1,I have been on an organic foods diet for almost a year now and I have become much more sensitive to what I eat and drink Out are the energy drinks loaded with sugars caffeine and artificial ingredients In are the more gentler and natural energy boosters This was  a surprise for me I really liked it and it did give an energy boost without any late energy crashesThe flavor is nice A good palatable taste and feel in the mouth No bad after taste It sits well on the stomach even an empty one It provides and fairly quick ramp up in energy and alertness and lasts for several hours to all day The ramp down in gently and hardly noticeable I like the ingredients and the overall effectI am finding that I need less energy boosting as my diet is becoming cleaner and healthier However I am going to rely on these until the day when I can maintain great energy levels without supports Or at least keeps a few in the fridge for special occasions 5 Stars easy Hope you get as much out of it as I have
1,I checked with Walmart and its the same price so I might as well have it delivered for FREE  I dont know anyone whos mother didnt bake with Bisquick  Its just like a hand down recipe  I purchased the Progressive Flour keeper to put it in since its such a large box and I dont want it to go bad  The flour keeper is 80oz so Ill just put some in another small progressive container or a zip lock bag  Either way that small part will be used first  I will cut out all the recipes on the box and store them in my recipe box
1,Fantastic  I have disability  this helps me with to my door delivery  not needing to schedule Disabled Van  pay fare both ways to go to the store
-1,Pasta Alfredo Hardly They should have called it Pasta Not So AlfredoMy only wish is that I could rate it 1 starIt came in a pack of 12 Ive got 11 that I dont wantAfter following directions to the letter I ate about half and threw the rest outIt made my stomach feel as if I had swallowed a stoneIn the past I have learned that you shouldnt expect super great taste out ofsuch types of products however very few have been THIS horrible It wasabsolutely disgustingI hate wasting food even if it is this bad Ive decided Im going to donate theother 11 packages to the local food pantry Maybe someone else will enjoy this
1,Was very fresh and satisfying
-1,there is something terribly wrong with this it is super cloudy and it makes me naseated I had finished a store bought tetra pack of coco libre a day before this came so I know i am not allergic to coconut water there is something off with this Zico 
-1,This is the product that rocked my world In a bad way After buying this I realized that some companies and people will do anything for a profit  like rip off their fellow man  Heres howZico used to be real 100 coconut water Now after conglomerate Coca Cola bought them its dumbed down its now part coconut water juice watered down with H2O water with unspecified natural flavor added so you are tricked into thinking your coconut water hasnt just been seriously diluted Why  Its cheaper  They save money by cutting it with plain water  But it wouldnt taste the same right  Thats where the flavoring comes in To trick youZico wont actually specify how much they water it down but you can guesstimate simply by their ads They brag this product has 30 less sugar than other brands  Ok that means this is likely a 70 coconut to 30 water mixture  Do you want 100 coconut water or 70 coconut water in your bottleThis isnt the ratio nature intended by the way  And if that means 30 less sugar ie 30 less actual coconut water in the bottle it also means 30 less electrolytes than you should be getting from a 100 product too  Its just logic
1,I am so glad Amazon has this set up for subscribe and save I send it out to my son every month as a care package and he practically inhales the stuff It has a great consistency and is much better than any other we have tried Try ityou wont be disappointed
-1,I recently bought Domino 10 lb premium cane sugar from a local grocery for about 8 and that makes a one lb batch around 08 That is regular powder not cubes as this one but other than that it is exactly the same In my book for a subtle difference in shape asking for 10x the price is a total rip off
1,I had been using Annies GF Mac n Cheese then I saw this It tastes about the same as the Annies GF powder cheese mix I didnt find this to be spectacular or easier to use I prefer the dry mix It is also more economical
-1,I TAKE CHANCES WITH THINGS I SHOULDNT  END RESULT I END UP GIVING THEM AWAY  EVERYONE ELSE LIKED THEM JUST NOT ME
